which php framework should i use for this project i have ready numerous posts here on so about framework vs framework however it seems to be alot of personal opinions that are one sided based on the following can someone tell me which framework would be ideal for my needs build a rich featured api where other sites and devices can use the api to use website features and access it s content rss feeds with both xml and json for jquery interaction ability to use layouts templates that are customizable use of plugins so that i do not need to duplicate code database querying with relationships great documentation actively supported doesn t require command line access easy to manage file uploads and move the files around so only certain users can download them customizable access level so users can have different access levels depending on which project section they are viewing low overhead usage seo urls that do not require the view edit add in the urls depending on which action you want to do support for jquery there have been a few frameworks i have seen that support some of these but not all i am currently using cakephp for one project but do not think it would fit my needs as the database querying can get horrendous i have heard a little bit about codeignitor however it doesn t seem to easily use templating maybe i just misunderstood what i read if you could tell me which framework you think would be ideal for these needs and why that would be very helpful >>> php

what would be a good language framework pair for learning web development what would be a good language framework pair for learning web development i know other people have asked this very same question for example learning web development choosing a language and framework however my case is a little different since i have some additional constraints the language the framework is written in must not be opinionated about the way i should do things on the other hand the framework being opinionated is not much of a problem as i can always at some point ditch replace it for with another framework or even my own mini framework the framework must let me see how it works aka i must have access to the source code which is not the same as the framework being open source i just want to be able to read the source also since my web server is a windows professional x machine with apache installed the framework must provide convenient access to at least one database engine that can be installed on windows professional x deployment of my web applications must be as easy as installing an apache module editing the httpd conf file properly and restarting apache optionally in decreasing order of priority it is desirable that the language the framework is written in be dynamic it is desirable that the framework provide convenient access to any sql database that can be installed on windows professional x it is desirable that the framework or a module plugin compatible with the framework provide convenient access to a non relational database that can be installed on windows professional x edit since my question has been labelled subjective and argumentative not only once but twice i want to clarify some things if the word ditch was too crude my apologies i already ditched replaced it by specifying that the language not be opinionated my intention is to avoid having to ask what is the recommendable standard approved blessed inherently good way to do something in the future i want to design my applications desktop or web entirely on my own if only to find out why some designs are not recommendable standard approved blessed inherently good by specifying that the framework let me study how it works my intention is to avoid having to ask why subsystem x throws error y when i try to do z i want to find it out on my own if only for education purposes there is nothing else i can find that i think can potentially be interpreted as subjective and argumentative in particular specifying an operating system and a web server just means i don t want to have to install other things than i already have installed on my pc besides apache is pretty much the standard web server yeah the question is open ended this is because i am asking for suggestions and since i am a complete newbie to web development there would be no point at least for me in arguing your suggestions also notice the question is community wiki >>> programming-languages

with this typical query are these indexes on my innodb table correct or should i change them i have a php query that runs fairly often like this one query select from work orders where end time gt and start time lt or start time lt and end time gt or start time gt and end time lt and a table defined as create table if not exists `work orders` `id` int not null auto increment `work order number` varchar collate latin general ci not null `start time` datetime not null `end time` datetime not null `client name` varchar collate latin general ci not null `location` varchar collate latin general ci not null `note` varchar collate latin general ci default null primary key `id` key `note idx` `note` key `client idx` `client name` key `location idx` `location` key `start time idx` `start time` key `end time idx` `end time` engine innodb default charset latin collate latin general ci auto increment i m often confused by how i should create indexes this is a read heavy table with lots of searching on the data which is why i have each column indexed but by far the query most often run uses the combinations of start and end date to determine if a work order falls in a particular calendar range should i have an index on start time and end time individually as i currently do or should i create a composite key out of the two is there a better way to set the indexes up in general should i even be using innodb i m not using transactions at all >>> sql mysql indexing innodb myisam

what are common application deployment and configuration best practices with net here s my current scenario which is specifically what i d like to discuss as a case study however i want this to be open enough to address other deployment practices for net projects i have a net wpf application written to perform manufacturing functional tests currently this software is deployed by copying the executable and it s dependancies to the target system the slave communications systems are installed similarly but installutil needs to be used to register a wcf windows service this is all being done manually furthermore configuration files are being read from custom xml data sources that are local to the application folder no app config is being used i think we can all agree this scenario is sub par and definately fails to even come close to an ideal launch condition my questions are as follows what should be used for setup and deployment setup and deployment wizard click once deployment how should i go about automating the installation of the windows service best way to specify custom username password for the afforementioned service what should be done about configuration if mutable application folder storage is considered harmful how should i go about this isolated application storage article links for any of the above would be ideal >>> .net deployment configuration

tools for creating a test like environment on a development database we have an oracle enterprise database in production and another instance that we use as both a qa and development database qa has requested that they be given separate schemas within the database so they can test applications isolated from changes made by developers for an example say the schema used in development and the one that will be used in production is called app owner and app owner could contain tables that have fk references to tables in other schemas say in base owner the idea would be to create a qa app owner schema and to pull over the production data into that schema as well as pulling any base owner tables referenced into the qa app owner schema as well a simplified illustration would be prod setup base owner users app owner users synonym to base owner users app owner audit users with fk to base owner users qa setup qa app owner users copied data from prod qa app owner audit users fk to app owner users this should be possible as we do not write code sql including schemas i e we create schema based synonyms for tables outside the schema the application is running in my question is are there good tools for easily creating such a qa app owner schema i m aware of the fromuser touser options of export but if i remember correctly this will move an entire schema to another schema but it won t get me all the way to where i want to be b c i need to change the references on the fks i m unaware of a way short of exporting the ddl manually changing it and then importing the data manually this is not an attractive option as many references are to tables that also reference other tables and the app owner schema has a plethora of tables itself my fear is the more manual this is the more likely hood of a mistake that will allow something being tested to break when moved to the production environment a nice solution would be to have licenses for both a dev and a qa instance of oracle but i have been told it isn t in the budget to do so >>> database oracle database-design testing oracle11g

how can i run ruby specs and or tests in macvim without locking up macvim about months ago i switched from textmate to macvim for all of my development work which primarily consists of coding in ruby ruby on rails and javascript with textmate whenever i needed to run a spec or a test i could just command r on the test or spec file and another window would open and the results would be displayed with the pretty format applied if the spec or test was a lengthy one i could just continue working with the codebase since the test spec was running in a separate process window after the test ran i could click through the results directly to the corresponding line in the spec file tim pope s excellent rails vim plugin comes very close to emulating this behavior within the macvim environment running rake when the current buffer is a test or spec runs the file then splits the buffer to display the results you can navigate through the results and key through to the corresponding spot in the file the problem with the rails vim approach is that it locks up the macvim window while the test runs this can be an issue with big apps that might have a lot of setup teardown built into the tests also the visual red green html results that textmate displays via format pretty i m assuming is a bit easier to scan than the split window this guy came close about mos ago http cassiomarques wordpress com running rspec files from vim showing the results in firefox the script he has worked with a bit of hacking but the tests still ran within macvim and locked up the current window any ideas on how to fully replicate the textmate behavior described above in macvim thanks >>> ruby-on-rails ruby vim rspec macvim

users have read access to sharepoint site even when all user permissions were removed i have a sharepoint site moss sp that all domain users seem to have read access to even if i remove all user permissions to the site i have no problem granting users all levels of permissions for example i can grant usera full access to my site but when i remove the user completely from the site they still have read access this is actually a subsite that does not inherit permissions from the parent this subsite also has subsites that either inherit or dont inherit permissions either way the issue seems to exist on all subsites of the affected site what makes this even stranger is that if i run a sql query to show who has access to a site it displays the same users that are listed on the permissions page for the site for example i give a user read access to the site then run the query that user will appear in the query results as having read access then i remove the user from the site permissions page and run the query again that user is gone from the query results and the permissions page but they still have read access to the site all users seem to have read access to this site and all its subsites even if they were never granted permissions to the site recently i installed a microsoft security patch that fixes a known issue caused by installing sp this is a link to that issue and the patch that fixes it http support microsoft com kb i am not sure if installing that patch was the cause of the issue but if it is why would it affect just that particular subsite and its decendants has anyone encountered anything like this before >>> sharepoint sharepoint-2007 permissions user-permissions

how to keep an array sorted i m refactoring a project that involves passing around a lot of arrays currently each method that returns an array sorts it right before returning it this isn t ideal for a couple reasons there s lots of duplicated code it s inefficient to sort an array two or three times and it s too easy to write a new function but to forget to sort the array before returning it i m looking for a way to guarantee that the array always kept in alphabetical order my current thought is to subclass nsmutablearray and or nsarray to create an alphabetized array class i would need to override all of the methods that create or modify the array to call super and then sort itself does this sound reasonable or is there a better approach edit since performance issues have been mentioned i ll include the relevant information from my project speed is not an important concern the whole process only takes a few seconds and the tool is only used every so often so simplicity and obvious correctness is more important also the use case for arrays is specific when an array is returned the caller always accesses every element in the array at least once >>> objective-c cocoa sorting nsarray subclassing

clever universal form partials in rails i have a widget for currencies which i use throughout my application ie the user changes the currency from eur usd or about other currencies i have a few other use cases such as dates but this one is the easiest to explain currency basically just updates a session variable by calling the currency controller and then uses some js to reload the page but i d like to only fetch certain elements of the page ie that reflect the currency change and nothing else #places list html lt escape javascript render partial gt places list gt or if another controller #locations html lt escape javascript render partial gt locations places gt but these elements are specific to the current controller ie rendering a controller specific partial such as a list the currency math itself is in a an application helper so no new logic is going on and the currency controller is simple a partial loaded by different controllers locations places etc other than making an action in every controller specific for this purpose how can i make it behave in a way that i can render elements specific to the current controller so i can replace them intelligently over js instead of reloading ie i can pass in to currency the current controller lt hidden field tag info controller controller name gt i m not sure if any of that makes sense but i hope it does at least in my own brain if not in anyone else s >>> ruby-on-rails ruby-on-rails-3 partial-views partial renderpartial

what fields should be indexed together group by order by i m trying to speed up a query which i currently have as select from `events` where field some string or field some string and is current true group by event id order by pub date this takes roughly seconds field is a varchar i m currently indexing field is current event id pub data charity pub date is current and all the fields individually i m really not sure what fields should be indexed together when i remove the order by the query speeds up to around seconds and if i removed both the order by and group by it s less than second what exactly should be indexed in this case to speed up the query edit i ve run explain on the modified query which no longer includes the group by id select type table type possible keys key key len ref rows extra simple events range is current field field field field field null using where using filesort which indicates it s using the key field which is field amp is current although it s not using the key which includes those two fields and pub date for the ordering it s also using filesort which seems to be the main problem any ideas why it s using a filesort even though the pub date field is also indexed with the other fields >>> mysql database query-optimization

wcf net tcp only service giving targetinvocationexception servicemodel communicationexception i m writing a wcf net tcp file transfer service which will eventually split files into several pieces and transfer said pieces to the client from the server service currently the client and server are console apps while writing this service i have at various times gotten the following exception system servicemodel communicationexception the socket connection was aborted this could be caused by an error processing your message or a receive timeout being exceeded by the remote host or an underlying network resource issue local socket timeout was actually it starts as a unhandled exception system reflection targetinvocationexception an exception occurred during the operation making the result invalid check innerexception for exception details then the communicationexception text above is right here in typical microsoft fashion that exception message is beyond unhelpful so i m finally calling out to the community to see if i can tackle this issue also in case this is important the client is calling two of the service s methods asynchronously initgetfilepart and getfilepart according to my logs the first call to initgetfilepartasync gets handled all the way to the end meaning that it s completed handler is called which in turn calls vcclient getfilepartasync filexfercargo and it s handler then spawns a backgroundworker thread workers chunknum runworkerasync cargoholder chunknum where chunknum which itself completes this is right about the time i get the targetinvocationexception mentioned above in the past i have made various tweaks sadly i can t remember what exactly to the app config to make this exception go away but now nothing i do seems to make any difference and i just do not understand why this keeps happening i have read other advice on this matter including you have to catch the exception on the client abort current proxy and create and open new one well i tried that but it doesn t appear i am able to catch this exception i also read that it could be due to sending too much data over the wire but when i try to send my little k test file i get the same exception during my investigations i also read that i can call wcf service function method many times using the async calls with the userstate parameter which i am doing i will admit to being a relitive n b when it comes to wcf but i m pretty sure i have my config files set correctly for what i m trying to do here are the client and server app config files the service

uidatepicker in popoverview in ipad i have an ipad specific application running ios which displays a settings view in a ui popover this all renders great but now i m trying to get a date picker to render inside the view and not sure what the best approach is for displaying it right now it has a button which toggles visibility of the date picker within the modal but that seems very clumsy for managing dismissal compared to the normal approach of an action sheet i haven t been able to find a best practice for this situation and was wondering if anyone s run into this before and could offer some suggestions or guidance thanks >>> ios ipad uidatepicker uipopovercontroller uiactionsheet
the way to maintain with git different hardware setups with a number of configs and a number of branches i have the git repository where i am storing different programs based on same code base some branches just have the different realization for some features and others do completely different things preparing the environment for calculation and calculation itself there is no problem for me to make different branches for it but also i need to maintain this on different hardware setups with different makefiles starting scripts and configs that are slightly different for different branches and hardware setups is there a possibility to separate the repositories or i need to design my code excluding overlaps and store things in different folders what i am looking for is the way to pick branch for program and config file and generate working code >>> git hardware config

using static keyword to limit access in c member functions i understand that one benefit of having static member functions is not having to initialize a class to use them it seems to me that another advantage of them might be not having direct access to the class s not static stuff for example a common practice is if you know that a function will have arguments that are not to be changed to simply mark these constant e g bool my class do stuff const int not to be changed std vector lt int gt const const not to be changed i can t change my int var my vector pointer or the ints inside it so is it valid to use static member functions to limit access for example lets say you have a function void my class print error const unsigned int error no switch error no case std cout lt lt bad read on lt lt std endl break default break well here we re not going to be accessing any member variables of the class so if i changed the function to static void my class print error const unsigned int error no switch error no case std cout lt lt bad read on lt lt std endl break default break i d now get an error if i inadvertently tried to access one of my private var etc unless i pass myself an instance of my class which would be purposeful is this a valid technique similar to proactively making args that should not be changed constants what downsides might it have in terms of efficiency or use my chief reason for asking is that most of the static tutorials i read made no mention of using it in this way so i was wondering if there was a good reason why not to considering it seems like a useful tool edit a further logical justification of this use i have a function print error as outlined above i could use a namespace namespace my space static void print error class my class void a void but this is a pain because i now have to lengthen all of my var declarations i e my space my class class all to remove a function from my class that essentially is a member of my class of course there s multiple levels of access control for functions can t change pointer to list directly void my class print error std vector lt int gt const error code list can t change pointer to list or list members directly void my class print error std vector lt int gt const const error code list can t change pointer to list or list members directly access non const member vars functions void my class print error std vector lt int gt const const error code list const can t change pointer to list or list members directly access non static member vars functions static void my class print error std vector lt int gt const const error code list can t change pointer to list or list members directly access member vars functions that are not both static and const static void my class print error std vector lt int gt const const error code list const sure this is a bit atypical but to lessening degrees so are using const functions and const variables i ve seen lots of examples where people could have used a const function but didn t yet some people think its a good idea i know a lot of beginning c programmers who wouldn t understand the implications of a const function or a static one likewise a lot would understand both so why are some people so adamantly against using this as an access control mechanism if the language spec provides for it to be used as such just as it does with const functions etc >>> c++ class function static scope

tokenizing source code in java for a systems software development course i m working on a complete assembler for an instructor invented assembly language currently i m working on the tokenizer while doing some searching i ve come across the java stringtokenizer class but i see that it has been essentially deprecated it seems far easier to use however than the string split method with regular expressions is there some reason that i should avoid using it is there perhaps something else within the typical java libraries that would suit this task well that i am not aware of edit giving more detail the reason i am considering string split complicated is that my knowledge of regular expressions is roughly that i know of them while it would be helpful for my general knowledge as a software developer to know them i m not sure that i want to invest the time right now especially if there is an easier alternative present in terms of my usage of the tokenizer it will go through a text file containing assembly code and break it into tokens passing the text and token type to a parser delimiters include white space spaces tabs newlines the comment start character which can occur on its own line or after other text and the comma to separate operands in an instruction i would write that more mathematically but my knowledge of formal languages is a bit rusty edit asking question more clearly i have seen the documentation on the stringtokenizer class it would have suited my purposes well but its use is discouraged other than string split is there something within the standard java libraries that would be helpful >>> java tokenize

does declaring c variables const help or hurt performance i understand the behavior of const qualified data types i am curious though if there is any performance gain or loss from over or under zealousness of qualifying variables as const i am thinking particularly of variables declared and used exclusively within an isolated code block for example something like const qreal padding calculatepadding const qsizef page size calculatepagepreviewsize padding const qrectf content rect calculatepagepreviewcontentrect page size const qlist lt qrectf gt pages renderer buildprintpages printer map scene const qfont page number font calculatepagenumberfont const qfontmetrics metrics page number font suppose i only need const qualified methods on all of these and more is there any performance gain in declaring them all const or conversely does this actually hurt performance i am curious for both run time performance i am guessing this makes no difference as the const is exclusively a compile time check can someone confirm and compile time performance i do not have enough experience with c to have a feel for this and am wondering if i should err on the side of over or under applying const when all other things maintainability etc are equal >>> c++ performance const

portable stream of bytes interface for c i work on an open source portable c image compression library currently my api works by exchanging pointers to byte arrays with image data i would like to support some kind of streaming mode for better performance and memory consumption for this i would like to know if there is an interface or abstract base class part of the c standard libraries that i can use as an interface to a stream of input bytes similar to java s inputstream or c# stream it could be as simple as this class inputstream public virtual void readbytes char size t count i could define an interface like this myself but then i require everybody to implement some kind of adapter to interface to my code and my flavor of io error handling and i would like to avoid that ideally this interface or base class would be already implemented by some existing c standard libraries for reading files if it is not a base class it should be totally abstract so my users can connect to whatever bytestream they have platform specific socket whatever i have browsed around in iostream but found nothing that fits the bill it should be as light weight as possible error handling should be defined but there s no need for seeking the stream if there is no such thing which i fear is there something like an existing best practice like a function pointer with a standard signature and a contract for error handling if there are creative solutions that would work in c as well i am also interested edit the key thing is that base class s read method s are virtual >>> c++ stream portability

best way for handling web releases using a staging enviroment i ve been designing and developing websites for a number of years now however whenever i make changes to a website i take the bad approach of making a modification replacing the orignal on the web server testing in browser and making more changes as needed i m looking for a better way to do this alternatively sometimes i ll work on a new version of page php by just copying it to pageeee php to make my modifications until its ready to launch but then i have issues with things such as my page rewrite rules breaking all links while i m testing etc i ve been thinking about just opening a new site thats basically mywebsite dev com where i can have a complete copy where i ll make all my changes and then just copy files over whenever i m ready to release i assume the best method is for me to learn how to use svn or something long story short what methods do you all use for developing in a beta test enviroment and then auto deploying to your production website bonus points if the solution allows for versioning rollback etc while still being resonably easy to use >>> svn testing release deployment

teamcity with multiple development environments for our enterprise application we have tiered streams in accurev developers promote to the integration stream which promotes to the quality assurance stream which promotes to the production stream each major component of the application has its own tiered set of streams e g there s a windows client integration stream a windows client quality assurance stream a data access services integration stream a data access services quality assurance stream etc i m in charge of setting up automated builds for the entire application in teamcity so far i ve created a separate build configuration for each of the major components e g a windows client build configuration right now these configurations pull from the aforementioned integration streams it works beautifully however what we would like to do is switch the build configurations to pull from different tiers in other words if we want to run an integration build of the windows client the build configuration will pull from the windows client integration stream in the case of a quality assurance build however it will pull from the quality assurance stream as far as i can tell the only way to accomplish this would be to create a separate build configuration for each tier e g windows client build configuration quality assurance is there an easier way or is there something fundamentally wrong with the way i ve set up the automated builds that s preventing me from accomplishing this >>> build-process build-automation teamcity accurev

unit testing arranging objects that are inaccessible to the test project i am writing a card game in an attempt to learn silverlight i have domain representation of the game which is exposed to silverlight as a wcf service and the only public method on my game object is playcards which is a method that looks like this public void playcards guid playerid list lt card gt cards when this method is invoked the game object is updated and transmitted to all the clients using a duplex binding there are lots of scenarios i need to unit test doing it via the ui is becoming really tedious especially as there are lots of scenarios that don t occur naturally that often however to do so would mean making various properties public that really don t need to be except for my testing purposes here s some specifics i have a game class that contains a list of players public class game public list lt player gt players get return players the player class has a hand public class player public hand hand get internal set the hand class has various parts public class hand public list lt card gt facedowncards get internal set public list lt card gt faceupcards get internal set public list lt card gt inhandcards get internal set now in my unit tests i want to set up various scenarios where one player has certain cards and the next player has certain cards then have the first player play some cards via the public playcards method and then assert on the game state but of course as players is a read only property i can t do this likewise hand on player is inaccessible likewise the parts of the hand any ideas how i can set this up i guess this might mean my design is wrong thanks edit here s what some classes look like to give you an idea of some of the properties i want to assert on after cards have been played i have changed the private setters to internal for the moment while i experiment with internalstovisible but am interested what the pure tdd way of doing things would be public class game public list lt player gt players get internal set public deck deck get internal set public list lt card gt pickuppack get internal set public cardlist clearedcards get internal set public player currentplayer get return players singleordefault o gt o isthisplayersturn internal direction direction get set public class player public guid id get internal set public game currentgame get internal set public hand hand get internal set public bool isthisplayersturn get internal set public bool isabletoplay get internal set public string name get internal set public class hand public list lt card gt facedowncards get internal set public list lt card gt faceupcards get internal set public list lt card gt inhandcards get internal set >>> c# unit-testing

how should i deal with object hierarchies in a restful api i am currently designing the api for an existing php application and to this end am investigating rest as a sensible architectural approach i believe i have a reasonable grasp of the key concepts but i m struggling to find anybody that has tackled object hierarchies and rest here s the problem in the application business object hierarchy we have users l which have one to many channel objects l which have one to many member objects in the application itself we use a lazy load approach to populate the user object with arrays of these objects as required i believe in oo terms this is object aggregation but i have seen various naming inconsistencies and do not care to start a war about the precise naming convention for now consider i have some loosely coupled objects that i may may not populate depending on application need from a rest perspective i am trying to ascertain what the approach should be here is my current thinking considering get only for the time being option fully populate the objects get api example com user user id read the user object resource and return the user object with all possible channel and member objects pre loaded and encoded json or xml pros reduce number of objects no traversal of object hierarchies required cons objects must be fully populated expensive option populate the primary object and include links to the other object resources get api example com user user id read the user object resource and return the user object user data populated and two lists each list references the appropriate sub resource i e api example com channel channel id api example com member member id i think this is close to or exactly the implications of hypermedia the client can get the other resources if it wants as long as i tag them sensibly pros client can choose to load the subordinates or otherwise better separation of the objects as rest resources cons further trip required to get the secondary resources option enable recursive retrieves get api example com user user id read the user object and include links to lists of the sub objects i e api example com user user id channels api example com user user id members the channels call would return a list of channel resources in the form as above api example com channel channel id pros primary resources expose where to go to get the subodinates but not what they are more restful no requirement to get the subordinates up front the subordinate list generators channels and members provide interfaces method like making the response more service like cons three calls now required to fully populate the object option re consider the object design for rest i am re using the existing application object hierarchy and trying to apply it to rest or perhaps more directly provide an api interface to it perhaps the rest object hierarchy should be different or perhaps the new restful thinking is exposing limitations of the existing object design any thoughts on the above welcomed many thanks paul >>> api class rest object hierarchy

how to make a command line interface from a given data model used for gui hi guys i am developing a gui to configure and call several external programs with python and i use wxpython for the gui toolkits basically instead of typing commands and parameters in each shell for each application one application via one shell the gui is visualizing these parameters and call them as subprocesses i have built the data model and the relevant view gui controls mainly by using the observer pattern or try to separate model with the gui widgets and it is ok now there is a request from my colleagues and many other people even including myself is it possible to have a command line interface for the subprocesses or even for the whole configuration gui based on the data model i already have this is due to the fact that many people prefer cli cli is better in reliability and also needs of programmer debugging and interfacing as i am rather new to developing a cli i really need some help from you i appreciate any advice and information from you to be more specific if i completely forget about the data model built for gui start from scratch is there some good materials or samples to have a reference if i still want to utilize the data model built for gui is it possible if possible what shall i do and any samples to follow do i need to refactor the data model is it possible to have the cli and gui at the same time i mean can i take the cli as another view of the data model or there is other right approach thank you very much for your help >>> python user-interface wxpython wxwidgets command-line-interface

function to create a tree of properties i am trying to create a list of properties for objects i can create a list for basic objects just fine but if i have a situation where type object a contains a property of type object b which contains a property of type object a well then i get infinite recursion what i ve done is added a static property to all of my objects called recursivepropertylist which is a list lt string gt of each property that has recursion so for example i have a person class with a property called vendor of type vendor the vendor class has a property called people which is of type list lt person gt in the person class i set the value of recursivepropertylist to mylist add vendor people in the vendor class i set the value of recursivepropertylist to mylist add people vendor then in my function that creates the property list i check to see if the current objectname propertyname is in the recursivepropertylist and if so i don t add it to my list of properties and don t drill down into it to get its properties this works great in the situation described above however it begins to fail when i have the following situation an application class that has a property of type list lt applicationfunction application gt an applicationfunction class that has a property of type list lt applicationfunction application gt an applicationfunction application class that has two properties one of type application and another of type applicationfunction the purpose of the applicationfunction application class is to define a many to many relationship between application and applicationfunction in the recursivepropertylist of application i put mylist add applicationfunctions application in the recursivepropertylist of applicationfunction i put mylist add applications

can two cvs trees independent cvs trees be merged how we had a cvs tree cvsrootv which uses java and websphere now because we are upgrading our systems we copied the whole cvs tree i e cvsrootv and make a new independent tree cvsrootv for java and websphere while having cvsrootv tree in production we started resolving some versioning issues with cvsrootv at the same time our developers did some changes in various files of cvsrootv now we want the changes in cvsrootv to be reflected in cvsrootv now there will be types of files corresponding to cvsrootv and cvsrootv files changed in cvsrootv but no change in cvsrootv files with no change in cvsroot but with come change in cvsroot files with some change in both cvsroot and cvsroot files with no change in either of the tree i e cvsrootv and cvsrootv can somebody guide us if it can be done automatically i mean can we write some kind of scripts for the automation process or there is no option to do it automatically please let me know if problem is not clear to you or u have any questions thanks >>> merge tree cvs
mockito mocks with spring argument passed to verify is not a mock i used the code from this blog to inject mockito mocks in my unit tests however before the mock is autowired it gets wrapped by spring in a jdk proxy this causes any verify autowiredmock to throw argument passed to verify is not a mock the exception is thrown when mockito is checking that the argument passed to verify is a valid mockito mock object in this method private static method getcallbackssetter class type string methodname throws nosuchmethodexception return type getdeclaredmethod methodname new class callback class my question is how to tell spring not to proxy mockito mock beans which i register in the beanfactorypostprocessor please note that i would like to avoid setting proxy target class true thanks >>> spring javabeans mockito

deploying a mercurial repository to production security concerns and tips in my research i found some concern around deploying an online php application while leaving its hg folder or svn folders in place on the production server unfortunately i was not able to find a clear explanation as to why this is a concern i would like to better understand this security risk it seems to me that you don t want these folders visible any more than you want the contents of the php files displayed wouldn t the solution be to configure the web server to not serve the hg directory does the security concern run deeper than this i really don t know your assistance with this is greatly appreciated if it is helpful the reason i want to keep version control on the server s production repository is the following faster deployment from staging vs doing a fresh copy per deploy easy and fast rollback capability the ability to verify that production remains unchanged via hg st alternatives are welcome thanks >>> php web-applications deployment mercurial security

custom nlog loglevels or multiple loggers per class how can i separate my normal logging auditing from my security logging auditing the windows event log makes this distinction with application events and security events if i could create a custom loglevel e g loglevel auditsuccess or loglevel auditfailure then i could set my config file rules to equal these and output those events for example lt logger name levels auditsuccess auditfailure writeto target gt lt logger name levels debug info writeto target gt then i could just use table record the level in a column and be able to search and sort my data using this column info i don t think we can create a custom loglevel one workaround that i come up with is to use loggers per class with each logger being saved to a different target however this seems like overkill especially if i need to add additional similar target types lt logger name mynamespace levels info error writeto target gt lt logger name mysecuritylogger levels info error writeto target gt public class myclass private static logger logger logmanager getcurrentclasslogger private statac logger loggersecurity logmanager getlogger mysecuritylogger with this i could create two database targets each with a different table and then create rule for each destination target any suggestions >>> logging nlog
design pattern for unique object per id system i have the follow classes c# for example class a private static dictionary lt int a gt idlookup private a id public static a get id does some magic if return idlookup id else a a new a id idlookup a id a return a class b private static dictionary lt int b gt idlookup private b id public static b get id does some magic if return idlookup id else b b new b id idlookup b id b return b and so on is there a design pattern was doing inheritance but that got a bit messy that can remove all that duplicate code the above functionality guarantees that only instance of a b exists for an id >>> c# design-patterns inheritance
wysiwyg web scraping crawling setup using javascript html my goal is to allow less experienced people to setup the required parameters needed to scrape some information from a website the idea is that a user enters an url after which this url is loaded in a frame the user should then be able to select text within this frame which should give me enough information to scrape this information again when this specific text changes dynamically the question is if it s even possible to detect what part of the source of an external site corresponds to the selection of the user in a frame if not are there any alternatives thanks in advance regards tom >>> javascript html5 screen-scraping wysiwyg web-crawler
