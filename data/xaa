axis axiom handling soap mtom non mtom attachments after looking around and trying different suggested solutions im writing this the most common solutions suggested to extract binary data from a mtom non mtom soap message are retrieve the omtext node and use the datahandler instance present within it find the omelement node which contains the href attribute get the cid xxxxx value and use the xxxxx part to retrieve the attachment from the attachment map present in the message context instance the problem im facing is that my client indicates that the soap response message is mtom i determined this using the isdoingmtom method of the message context instance however there are no omelement nodes which contain the href attribute on printing the soap envelope i found that the binary data is present inline within the body so i tried the omtext node approach to get the data but whenever i try to cast the omelement to the corresponding omtext node i keep getting a classcastexception can someone point out what im missing out on >>> java-ee axis2 mtom

generating a random sequence with no repeats i read a couple of posts here about generating random sequence without repeats for example http stackoverflow com questions create random number sequence with no repeats and decided to implement it for my own need actually it was an algorithm applying some non destructive reversible operations with the bits of the current counter in order to get a pseudo random number that should appear only once since the operations are reversible different source numbers will give different result numbers there are at least several operation possible like exchange two bits invert a bit cyclic shift if we use only ones mentioned the quality of the sequence won t be great since the nearby counter will produce results with similar number of zeros and ones the real game changer was xor one bit by another bit now the sequences looks much better but the questions are is there smallest subset of the operations that will be enough for example invert bit xor bit by another bit and adding any other just will make the algorithm harder to read while giving no extra benefits how can i approximately guess the number of operations for a given range in order for the sequence to be good enough for example operations for numbers from to gives visually good results but operations for the range sometimes gives blocks of close numbers is there an algorithm or a test suite for testing such sequences i m aware and used once the suites that can test general random sequences but this one is a different so probably some special suite needed or at least some conversion back to the general random world update as i posted in the comment here there s already a generator like this aes encryption but unfortunately it can only be used for bit ranges thanks max >>> algorithm random sequence

symfony with zend lucene and related models with foreign keys well i was developing an application usin symfony and doctrine when i realized a major drawback on my zend lucene implementation i have a model called publication that is related via foreign key relations with a few other models subjects genres languages authors etc and i m getting they re names when adding a new document to the index using the jobeet tutorial way so that i can search for publications with a given subject genre language author etc the problem is if for some reason i decide to alter the name of one of those related models the zend lucene index will not get updated the only two solutions i could come up with were re index all the publications regularly to guarantee that any changes made to the related models gets updated on the index however this solution doesn t allow the index to be updated in real time get all the publications that are related with a given model and re index them after it gets updated using the save postsave postupdate or whatever you can come up with on doctrine this solution seemed great it will only rebuild the index for the publications that are linked to the updated model right well if you have something like a thousand publications linked to it will take a few minutes to update yeah i tested it and on a user form it will timeout because it takes over seconds and even if it don t it would be bad to have a user looking at the screen for a few minutes awaiting for the page to finish to load so what i want to know is if there s another solution is there a way to update an index on the fly based on a change on a related model without hanging the whole pahe maybe putting the task to run on the background or something is there such a way if there s no way to do this with lucene is there any way to use full text search with mysql with innodb tables without using zend lucene that doesn t have such a drawback if there s such a tool i d glady refactor my code to accommodate a different library could you please help me with this thanks in advance >>> php zend-framework symfony1 indexing lucene

are there some best practices when it comes to object graph serialization using wcf i am using wcf with entity framework v and using poco entities our entities have a large number of related entities one object can have many children objects of a different type which then in turn of many children of different types for example a car has or many drivers each driver has or many children each child then has or many friends poor child with friends the example is a bit daft but you get the point if the client wanted to ask for a car it would make sense to return the car with a list of its drivers it might or might not make sense to populate and return each driver s children and the problem goes on and on because your database almost always consists of only interconnected tables leading to interconnected entities how much of the object graph should we serialize is there a best practice when it comes to soa should it only be the immediately related entities is there some sort of naming convention should we use different methods for example getcar and getcarwithdrivers >>> wcf soa

mvvm how to design a window hosting different applications i am trying to implement a simple wpf data analysis application using the mvvm design pattern in which one can use several different methods to analyse some data loaded from files in the first screen the user should be able to choose the method he likes to employ after he has done that and loaded the data the area previously occupied by the method selection screen should be replaced by the analysis results currently my mainwindowviewmodel has a property currentviewmodel of type object that can be set to either the method selection viewmodel or on of the analysis results viewmodels which are then rendered by using datatemplates the problem i am facing is that i don t know how the different viewmodels should communicate the method selection screen needs a list of available methods the main screen needs to know what method was selected and choose the approriate viewmodel to display the results the data loaded somehow needs to get into the class doing the actual work and the results viewmodel needs to know about this to know where to get its data from everything i can think of leaves the mainwindowviewmodel to do all the negotiating between the different viewmodel and model classes how would i optimally design this >>> c# wpf mvvm

why wasn t yield added to c x i have been using yield in many of my python programs and it really clears up the code in many cases i blogged about it and it is one of my site s popular pages c# also offers yield it is implemented via state keeping in the caller side done through an automatically generated class that keeps the state local variables of the function etc i am currently reading about c x and its additions and while reading about the implementation of lambdas in c x i find out that it was done via automatically generated classes too equipped with operator storing the lambda code the natural question formed in my mind they did it for lambdas why didn t they consider it for support of yield too surely they can see the value of co routines so i can only guess that they think macro based implementations such as simon tatham s as an adequate substitute they are not however for many reasons callee kept state non reentrant macro based that alone is reason enough etc edit yield doesn t depend on garbage collection threads or fibers you can read simon s article to see that i am talking about the compiler doing a simple transformation such as int fibonacci int a b while true yield a int c a b a b b c into struct generatedfibonacci int state int a b generatedfibonacci state a b int operator switch state case state while true return a case int c a b a b b c garbage collection no threads no fibers no simple transformation arguably yes >>> c++ c++11 yield

running r jobs on a grid computing environment i am running some large regression models in r in a grid computing environment as far as i know the grid just gives me more memory and faster processors so i think this question would also apply for those who are using r on a powerful computer the regression models i am running have lots of observations and several factor variables that have many s or s of levels each as a result the regression can get computationally intensive i have noticed that when i line up regressions in a script and submit it to the grid it exits crashes due to memory constraints however if i run it as different scripts it runs fine i m doing some clean up so after each model runs i save the model object to a separate file rm list ls to clear all memory then run gc before the next model is run still running all three in one script seems to crash but breaking up the job seems to be fine the sys admin says that breaking it up is important but i don t see why if i m cleaning up after each run in one script runs them in sequence anyways does anyone have an idea why running three individual scripts works but running all the models in one script would cause r to have memory issues thanks exl >>> r memory-management grid-computing

what drawbacks are there to maintaining a table of calculated records with triggers and fk constraints i have a table containing roles many users can be assigned to a role permissions can be assigned to a role granting all users to that role with the permission when i assign a permission to a role that has hundred people i ve effectively created permission assignments with each permission that is assigned to a role i specify a complex calculation that must take place when determining what type of permission access each individual with that role has for example if i assign a read email permission to an accountant role at the time i do that i also include a variable that specifies which mailbox types are being permitted as there are multiple mailbox types and the accountants should only have access to a certain group of them so when i want to find out which individuals have access to which specific mailboxes i have to not only join my permissions roles and users tables but i need to do a lookup that for reasons which are hard to explain in the space here is time consuming and cannot be made faster the problem i run into is that when i expose all calculated permission assignments in a view joining all those tables doing the complex time consuming calculation it takes a very very long time it occurred to me that i could simply create a user role permission table which is populated via triggers activated by assigning a user to a role or by assigning a permission to a role whenever a permission is assigned to a role it would insert a record for each individual having that role and would do the complex lookup at that time putting records into this table whenever a user is assigned to a role it would generate any permissions complex lookups there would be foreign keys from this table to the role assignment table and the permission assignment tables with cascading deletes permission to role assignment is rare so it s fine if that is slowed down greatly of the access to my tables is select any drawbacks to this method i need real time data am i just engineering my own on commit materialized view any other suggestions >>> sql oracle views rdbms materialized-views

how to create a simple company blog with a tag cloud in drupal i have to create a simple company blog within drupal that means there should be only one single blog each user can post into what i have done so far is to create a custom content type blog and a view that displays teasers of the recent blog entries with links to the full blog post now i have to create a tag cloud for this blog i created a taxonomy vocabulary for this blog content type and set the settings to tags terms are created by users when submitting posts by typing a comma separated list i also installed the tagadelic module and created a tag cloud with it that works great and it displays all the tags i entered when creating new blog entires but now to my problems first if i click on an entry in this tag cloud the default taxonomy term view is used to display the resulting blog entries thats bad because i would like to have it displayed the same way as in the view i already defined to show the blogs is there a way to use my view to display the results of the tag cloud second on my view below each blog teaser should be a link to related blog entries the ones that share the same terms i do not have a clue how to do that is this even possible with the setting i have now or should i maybe take a whole other approach to create that company blog with tag clouds and related blog entries >>> drupal drupal-6 blogs tag-cloud

import from a django project with a different top level folder name i recently setup a deployment solution for my django project using fabric the basic workflow being check out the latest source from git on the server copy it to a releases directory and add a timestamp to the directory name update the current symlink to point to the latest build this works just fine only problem is since the top level directory is a symlink called current and that points to a folder like project name all of the following import statements will fail from project name app import models installed apps project name app urlpatterns patterns r project name app views index so the solution i ve found is to remove every single reference to project name in my project and the app seems to deploy and work just fine for now but this doesn t seem like the right way to solve the problem mostly because in a newly created django project the urls py settings py all reference the project name by default and also various django documentation mentions using the project name for various things so to sum up my problem is there a way to specify a package name that differs from the actual directory name >>> python django fabric importerror

how to deploy via capistrano webistrano from two different git repositories applications to same server we have two applications running on production servers each in its own directory under usr local

some recipe changes that were made to support our configuration original configurator is no longer with us now we re trying to create a project in webistrano to allow deployments of app but we re running into some problems looks like the problem area is the usr local shared cached copy directory since it s already on the staging production server for app the deploy script looks in it for the

date axis labeling algorithm for excel i routinely graph time series data in excel and i find the default excel date axis labeling on line graphs to be very ugly in particular dates are often rotated horizontally or vertically which compresses plot area real estate and makes the date labels harder to read this is because there are two many major tick marks labels show too much precision time series databases will typically dump something like a monthly time series into the spreadsheet with date values like etc excel will try to show the full mm dd yyyy date string by default which might be preferable for a short daily time series but is undesirable for a non daily series or a series that runs over a long time period in these cases formatting like mm yyyy or yyyy might be preferable my question is does anyone have a good algorithm already written that can make a pretty date label axis horizontal labels only with ticks spaced far enough to accommodate that and intelligent formatting of the date as the data starts to cover a longer and longer time span i e labels that transform from to to i will ultimately have to write this using vba but i could translate an algorithm written in another language thanks >>> excel vba

interpolate x y z coordinates on a sphere using points from two spin vectors i want to plot d points in real time that lie upon the surface of a unit sphere r there are two spin vectors at work here one vector rotates around the y axis it s x and z values are calculated using the cos and sin of a circle that lies completely on the x z plane with all y values being equal to the other rotates around the x axis it s z and y values calculated using the cos and sin of a circle that lies completely on the z y plane with all x values being equal to the angular momentum of the two vectors are usually not the same however the endpoints of the vectors lie along the surface of a common sphere with a radius equal to they are therefore of equal magnitude and both originate from the same point let s say the first vector has an angular momentum term called angxz and the second angzy that means at any time i can calculate two points one for each spin vector using angxy and angzy with those two d points what is the formula for calculating a third point that also would lie on the surface of the unit sphere and would be the correct interpolation between the two points calculated from angxz and angzy i can see in my head that given any two d points that lie on the surface of a unit sphere there is one and only circle plane whose circumference they would both lie on i can also intuit that calculating the coordinates of the interpolated point comes down to bisecting the angle that is created by the two calculated points when projected onto the circle whose circumference they both share but i just can t wrap my head around the translations and mathematics is there a simple formula that takes two d points that lie upon the surface of a unit sphere to calculate a third point that also would lie upon that surface and would be the correct interpolation between the first two points i am using delphi pro if that matters follow up it seems intuitively that i should be able to take the linear midpoint of the two points calculated from the pair of spin vectors and project that point back on to the unit sphere for example the formula found on the link below gives equations for calculating the midpoint between any two d points should t i be able to then take that d point and using some formula adjust it s xyz coordinates in a manner that projects it back to the surface of the unit sphere http stackoverflow com questions finding coordinates of a point between two points >>> vector geometry sine cosine angular-momentum

finding out which instance of a form initiated another form or module i m trying to figure out the best way to reference a control on a form from within a module unfortunately the form is just an instance so it s not as easy as calling form control dim childform as new frmsearch make it a child of this mdi form before showing it childform mdiparent me childform show that form has an option for printing which calls another form where certain options are chosen the print form in turn calls a function in a module which tries to reference back to the origional form childform as new frmsearch gt frmprintform gt sub oktoprint in module print oktoprint tries to reference a listview on frmsearch but can t find it for each itmx in frmsearch lstresults items so the solutions i can think of off the top of my head are somehow divine which form is the caller of frmprintform pass childform to the frmprintform as a variable to be passed on to module print use frmsearch directly instead of using an instance of it number would be my preference as i don t want to have to pass forms around like that >>> .net vb.net

how do you write a operator or less than functor neater than a trivalue compare function writing an operator lt for a struct appears to be clearer than writing the classical trivalue compare for example to sort the following struct s int val you can write an operator lt bool operator lt const s amp l const s amp r return l val lt r val or a trivalue function usually in the following fashion int compare const s amp l const s amp r if r val gt l val return if r val lt l val return return the former is clearer therefore you can say there s better code quality the latter forces you to think of cases which complicates code but this thought is a bit deceiving in more complex structures struct s int x int y the following is clear and begginners tend to write it like so bool operator lt const s amp l const s amp r if l x lt r x return true if l y lt r y return true return false but it s wrong you can t sort correctly with this and it takes some time to think that you actually have to write it like so bool operator lt const s amp l const s amp r if l x lt r x return true if l x gt r x return false if l y lt r y return true if l y gt r y return false return false for it to work correctly can you and do you write this sort of compare function in a nicer clearer manner the old trivalue compare function at least forced you into thinking about lt and cases >>> c++ stl

ajax synchronous sjax on session restore i have a large web page classic asp with lots of information required from the user so lots of inputs the user s behavior is that he will fill in the information over time analyze it and other time consuming processes before submitting the problem is that even though the session timeout is set to a reasonable minutes often i get complaints that when submitting the user gets the timeout message and loses all his work all he filled in before i thought it would be elegant to check on the submit event if the session is abandoned in which case to have a login form appear by using ajax synchronous for the session check and for the login itself the state of the web page will remain unaltered allowing the user to continue with the submit after the session has been restored however i ve been reading about the perils of synchronous and how it is recommended to avoid when possible for me it seems that this is one of those cases when synchronous is required but i didn t find anyone that has done this before i am looking for advice on whether this is a good course of action using ajax synchronous for a session restore thank you >>> ajax session restore synchronous

jquery event keycode when swedish keys and are pressed i have an html form with a lot of text fields that all take only one character think crossword puzzle when a letter is entered in an input field i use jquery to jump to the next one this works fine except for the swedish characters other international characters are probably affected too i bind an event listener to the keyup event and use the event keycode and event which to determine if the pressed key was a letter if it was any special key the events passes untouched the problem is that when i press or both event keycode and event which are when i examine the event object in firebug i can t find any attribute that seems to hold the key code the code looks like this var crossword article crossword crossword bind keyup function event var target event target crossword if target hasclass crossword letter input var pressedkey event which event which event keycode var target value target val var target tabindex regular alphanumeric keys have keycodes between and if pressedkey gt amp amp pressedkey lt amp amp target value length target tabindex parseint target attr tabindex input crossword letter input tabindex target tabindex crossword focus i use the keyup event in order to move focus after the character has been entered into the text field if you know of any jquery plugin or vanilla js that could replace this completely that would also be a solution edit i have made a temporary and ugly fix by inserting the following else if and reports keycode for some reason else if pressedkey amp amp target value length target tabindex parseint target attr tabindex input crossword letter input tabindex target tabindex crossword focus this way i simply suppose that if the event which and event keycode was both and the length of the value in the field is greater than focus should be moved to the next input supposing stuff without knowing doesn t feel great though >>> jquery internationalization keyboard-events

trying to replace char using javascript for a json parser i have the following line of javascript yahoo lang json parse txt where text is a string that is pulled from the database this is an example of one of the problem strings i m getting back the json parser is throwing syntax errors on the character as far as i can tell i looked through threads here and most of them are saying to change it to but i m pulling hundreds of values from a database so i can t change their source i m trying to get it to replace the char with just the empty string since i don t actually have to display the but i m having difficulties my current replace code looks like this if substr indexof substr replace g but nothing is happening sometimes the indexof check fails so i tried running the replace on every string and it still didn t replace any of the chars so here is my question if i get back a string with one or more characters and need to remove them for a json parser using javascript how do i do that or how do i get a json parser to accept the char without changing the source string edit i think what might be the problem is that and all the other ones are evaluating and exceping characters that don t do anything these characters are always escaped so they cannot be replaced is this even possible to fix the error >>> javascript string json replace backslash

how often should each object s getobjectdata method be called during custom serialization i m serializing the data in my app using custom serialization i e each of the classes i m storing has the serializable attribute and implements iserializable the object graph being serialized is reasonably complex with lots of cross references between the objects classes the serialization works but it s pretty slow by putting a breakpoint in each relevant class s getobjectdata method i ve found that i m getting many many more hits than i ve got objects i m confused my understanding of the serialization framework was that it would store each object only once even if the object graph contained multiple references to it i assumed that this meant each object s getobjectdata method would need to be called only once during saving am i wrong and if so is there anything i can do in this approach to reduce the number of calls to my classes getobjectdata methods thanks >>> .net performance serialization iserializable

how should i wall off the dev and or beta sites from the public and search engine bots i need dev and beta sites hosted on the same server as the production environment let s let that fly for practical reasons to keep things simple i can accept the same protections in place on both dev and beta basically don t let it get spidered and put something short of user names and passwords in place to prevent everyone and their brother from gaining access again there s a need to be practical i realize that many people would want different permissions on dev than on beta but that s not part of the requirements here using robots txt file is a given but then the question should the additional host s aka subdomain s be submitted to the google webmaster tools as an added preventive measure against inadvertent spidering it should go without saying but there will be no linking into the dev beta sites directly so you d have to type in the address perfectly with no augmentation by url rewrite or other assistance how could access be restricted to just our team ip addresses won t work because of the various methods of internet access meetings at lunch spots with wifi etc perhaps having dev beta and production include a small file or call a component that looks for url variable to be set on the dev beta sites or does not look for the url variable on the production site this way you could leave a different include or component named the same on the respective sites and the source would otherwise not require a change when it s moved from development to production i really want to avoid full on user authentication at any level app level or web server and i realize that leaves things pretty open but the goal is really just to prevent inadvertent browsing of pre production sites >>> security development-environment
how to create a fully parameterized method delegate in c# in c# we can create delegates via a variety of means e g action lt func lt delegate lambdas etc but when you invoke those methods you have to provide the parameter values for the delegate you are invoking delegate int del int i del mydelegate x gt x x int j mydelegate is there a way in c# to encapsulate a method delegate with parameter values essentially delay invocation of a fully parametrized method so you don t have to supply parameter values at invocation time for example something like this invalid code delegate int del int i del mydelegate x gt x x int j mydelegate i m aware the use case isn t immediately obvious in the case i m currently looking at i have a non deterministic method that i would like the caller to be able to invoke without having to contain or be aware of the parameters the method needs one way to achieve this would be via creating a class that encapsulates both the parameter values and the method delegate and have that referenced and invoked by the caller but i m just curious if there is an alternate more succinct way >>> c# .net delegates

avoid or embrace c# constructs which break edit and continue i develop and maintain a large k loc winforms app written in c# it s multi user and is currently deployed on about machines the development of the system is ongoing can be thought of as a perpetual beta and there s very little done to shield users from potential new bugs that might be introduced in a weekly build for this reason among others i ve found myself becoming very reliant on edit and continue in the debugger it helps not only with bug hunting and bug fixing but in some cases with ongoing development as well i find it extremely valuable to be able to execute newly written code from within the context of a running application there s no need to recompile and add a specific entry point to the new code having to add dummy menu options buttons etc to the app and remembering to remove them before the next production build everything can be tried and tested in real time without stopping the process i hold edit and continue in such high regard that i actively write code to be fully compatible with it for example i avoid anonymous methods and inline delegates unless completely impossible to rewrite generic methods except in stable unchanging utility code targeting projects at any cpu i e never executing in bit initializing fields at the point of declaration initialisation is moved to the constructor writing enumerator blocks that use yield except in utility code now i m fully aware that the new language features in c# and are largely incompatible with edit and continue lambda expressions linq etc this is one of the reasons why i ve resisted moving the project up to a newer version of the framework my question is whether it is good practice to avoid using these more advanced constructs in favor of code that is very very easy to debug is there legitimacy in this sort of development or is it wasteful also importantly do any of these constructs lambda expressions anonymous methods etc incur performance memory overheads that well written edit and continue compatible code could avoid or do the inner workings of the c# compiler make such advanced constructs run faster than manually written expanded code >>> c# debugging lambda anonymous-methods edit-and-continue

logging server wide request data including post data in iis asp net webforms here s the big picture we re running a server in iis that hosts several web sites and applications and we re in the process of moving the whole thing to a different data center with a slightly different setup we ve notified our users and updated our dns info so that theoretically everyone will be happily hitting the new server from day but we know that someone will inevitably fall through the cracks the powers that be want a listener page handler that will receive all requests to the server and log the entire request to a text file including especially post data that s where i m stuck i don t know how to implement a single handler that will receive all requests to the server i vaguely understand iis redirection options but they all seem to lose the post data on the redirect i also know a little about iis s built in logging but it ignores post data as well is there a simple ish way to route all requests to the server so that they all hit a single handler while maintaining post data edit this is in webforms if that matters but other solutions if small are definitely worth considering >>> asp.net http logging post iis-6

how to handle projects one that contains the other if you had a svn repo set up for a script like a shopping cart how would you handle a site that will use the cart but contain custom features as well you need source control on the custom parts so you add a new repo do you copy the script repo to the site specific one if you do and bug fixes are applied to the script you would also have to apply them to this project would it be better to have a custom build script that gets code from locations that would only work if the code being modified isn t part of the first repo >>> svn

getting value of numericupdown moves caret position can i stop this i ve noticed that when i request the value of a numericupdown control in a c# app the caret is reset to position this is annoying because my app is periodically grabbing the value of the control so if this happens while a user is typing into it the caret unexpectedly moves messing with their input is there a way to prevent this or a workaround it doesn t seem to have a selectionstart property otherwise i could have the polling process save the caret position get the value then set it back as a decent workaround >>> c# winforms numericupdown

how to unit test client side jquery javascript inside asp net mvc microsoft has really been pushing asp net mvc and one of its major strengths over asp net web forms is unit testing then they announced that they would support jquery as their official client side library for the platform automatically including the source in new projects recently they announced their first official contributions to the jquery stack templating data linking and globalization my question is with this push to more and more client side logic how does microsoft expect developers to unit test with the same power and flexibility that they offer through mvc is there a unit testing framework for client side scripting that even comes close to comparing to what is available through asp net mvc does microsoft endorse or offer a specific framework that provides this functionality >>> jquery asp.net-mvc unit-testing client-side

does in c behave the same as in java my question is essentially in the title basically i ve learned that in java the amp amp operator acts like a short circuit so that if the first condition evaluates to false it doesn t look at the rest of the statement i assumed this was the case in c but i m writing a bit of code which first checks that an index has not exceeded a list size then compares that index in the list to another number something like let s say list size for int i i lt i if i lt list size amp amp list get i do something that s not the exact code but it illustrates the point i assume that since i the list size the second half won t get evaluated but it appears that it still does and i believe this is causing a seg fault i know i can use nested ifs but that s such an eyesore and a waste of space any help >>> java c++ logical-operators

size of class instance i m working with a class for which the new operator has been made private so that the only way to get an instance is to write foo foo foo writing foo foo new foo does not work but because i really want a pointer to it i simulate that with the following foo foo foo malloc sizeof foo foo foo so that can test whether the pointer is null to know whether is has already been initialized it looks like it works from empirical tests but is it possible that not enough space had been allocated by malloc or that something else gets funny edit a didn t mention the context because i was not actually sure about why they the new operator was disabled this class is part of a constraint programming library gecode and i thought it may be disabled in order to enforced the documented way of specifying a model i didn t know about the concrete data type idiom which looks like a more plausible reason that allocation scheme may be fine when specifying a standard model in which everything is specified as cdts in the space derived class but in my case these instance are each created by specific classes and then passed by reference to the constructor of the class that reprensents the model about the reason i m not using the foo f foo pf amp f it would be like doing case below which throws a returning reference to local variable warning int amp f int a return a case int amp f int a int ap amp a return ap int amp f int ap int malloc sizeof int ap return ap this warning disappears when adding a pointer in case but i guess it is because the compiler loses tracks so the only option left is case not mentioning that additionaly ap is a member of a class that will be initialized only once when f is called will be null otherwise and is the only function returning a reference to it that way i am sure that ap in this case when lose its meaning because of the compilier optimizing it away may that happen but i guess this reaches far too much beyond the scope of the original question now >>> c++
