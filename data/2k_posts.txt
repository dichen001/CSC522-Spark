delphi bitmap only updates when owner window requires a repaint when using the graphics library i have an application that creates d motion on a tpaintbox canvas using native delphi code in the old code i rendered the d image to a temporary tbitmap on a timer event in the tpaintbox onpaint event i would bitblt the temporary tbitmap the tpaintbox s canvas this approach worked fine but the motion was jerky because i was not happy with the smoothness of the motion i decided to try rendering instead to a very large workspace bitmap and then down sample it to the tpaintbox canvas to do the re sampling i used the graphics library which i read about here http stackoverflow com questions scale an image nicely in delphi i changed my code to render to a large tbitmap w x h and then when i down sample it i use a graphics tkernelresampler object with a tlanczoskernel kernel to do the down sampling to another tbitmap that is the exact same size as the tpaintbox canvas and call the tpaintbox s refresh method in the tpaintbox onpaint event i bitblt the down sampled tbitmap to the tpaintbox canvas this works but the problem is i only see repaints when the form that owns the tpaintbox requires a repaint a problem i did not have with the old code despite the face that i call the refresh method on the tpaintbox right after i m done rendering to it as i said as a validity test i called savetofile on both the large hi res tbitmap object and the smaller tbitmap object i use for pre rendering the bitmaps showed that indeed the frame had not changed in content at all between timer events so it s not a weird repaint related issue at least not with the tpaintbox component if i invalidate the form s canvas by moving the form or overlaying any part of it s client area with another form then the content of the tbitmap objects do update and so do the bitmap images i save to disk as a check it s as if the graphics tbitmap object s themselves need to be invalidated so that the new content i rendered to the large hi res workspace is updated however tbitmap has no such invalidate refresh call if anyone out there is experienced with the graphics library and can tell me why i m only seeing the images change when the form requires a repaint or has it s client area invalidated then i would appreciate that >>> delphi refresh repaint invalidate graphics32

clearing session data in jsf let s say i have a transactional application that consists of four pages an origination page which uses post parameters to initialize the application a transaction page where data additional data is captured a review page where data is reviewed a confirmation page where submitted data is confirmed assume request parameters via post are passed from to initialize the session which is created upon the application has both a cancel button and a submit button on pages both actions should trigger a data reset where any previous values held in request session page should be reset the obvious solution is to clear out session values in an actionlistener on the submit button in but if i do that i will not have those values to display in the confirm page another solution is to clear out data prior to entry to the application but if i do that i potentially lose the request parameters am i missing something obvious here what is the best place to reset data in a transactional application such as mine >>> web-applications jsf

performing a contains within an intersect i have a fairly complicated linq query that returns an item and a string of one column in the item s many to many relationship so i return an anonymous type sort of like this var q from k in db items join m in db manyrel on k id equals m itemid select new k list from t in m where t itemid k id select t name so the anonymous type is iqueryable lt k gt iqueryable lt string gt what i then want to do is search through the list for intersections from string input q select x gt new x k partialmatches exactmatches x tags intersect input count i currently have it working with intersect but intersect only matches against the entire element i would like to somehow use contains within intersect to count the number of partial matches i would prefer to do this without an extension method if possible edit jon amp timwi i tried both of your versions they were pretty much the same and they find if any item in input partially exists within x tags i d like to be able to count how many items in input partially exist within x tags not just whether an item exists thanks for the responses i think i have a better handle on the asenumerable stuff than i did a few nights ago also for the record because you where both curious the intersect method does not translate to linq to sql and neither do the any methods you each proposed they all work well and fast enough with asenumberable however >>> c# linq

how many variables point to the object and which net i want to make my own xml serializer class because i need other formatting than the system xml serialization xmlserializer does my idea is to treat properties of primitive type such as integer double string as xmlattributes to properly implement a usable xml serialization i need to know which variables point to the same object the binary serialization behaves this way because one object should be serialized only once in order that the connections don t get lost on the side of xmlserialisation i have the idea to insert a path to the class as a special xmlattribute do you have tipps for me how to handle such a situation ### edit thanks for the answers xmlattributeattribute is maybe more work than writing my own serializer because only variables of primitive types and there are many of them should be serialized as xmlattributes making a mistake there is more horrible then i would use a kind of hashing solution of course so far so good but my idea was to reduce the work of this hashing solution if i could make sure the object is referenced only once do you have links to such a question >>> c# .net vb.net serialization xml-serialization

subversion on a shared development server i m thinking about implementing source control at my work ideally i wanted to use subversion since it seems to be the tool of choice at the moment however i seem to have hit a brick wall since it just isn t practical for all our developers to work in local environments we do web development with coldfusion and use a shared development server changes made to files can quickly be refreshed in the browser our company maintains over sites and our development server mirrors all these sites on production we often have to make quick tweaks to of these test it and quickly upload it to production if we had to download a given site locally set it up in our local webserver these small changes would become more time consuming tasks also often are copywriters and less technical folk will want to go into an html page and change copy this is straightforward in our current shared server setup a long time ago we used a source control called ngsource when you checked a project into the repository it changed the file permissions to read only we d check the file out to the shared dev server and it would change the permission to read and write we d all check the repository to make sure someone wasn t working on a file we thought to work on this worked well and was explainable to copywriters the problem was that ngsource client was slow and they might be out of business as far as i know so is there a way to implement this changing of file permissions on check in and check out with subversion if not is there a better open source solution is it so bad to develop in a shared environment and skip developing locally >>> svn version-control source

ok to wrap jsf components generated html with own divs using jquery after page load using richfaces jsf and facelets for some presentation purposes i need to wrap the contents of some divs with other divs to be able to style them a certain way i am using jquery to do this as its cleaner when writing html and it can be controlled in one location otherwise i have to hardcode the extra divs every place i want to use them eg original jsf generated html lt div id j id main container gt lt div id j id j id nav gt lt div gt lt div gt after using jquery the html now looks like this lt div id j id main container gt lt div class top gt lt div gt lt div gt lt div gt lt div class middle gt lt div id j id j id nav gt lt div gt lt div gt lt div class bottom gt lt div gt lt div gt lt div gt lt div gt can this cause problems i am going against this rule from the jboss richfaces documentation which says any ajax framework should not append or delete but only replace elements on the page for successful updates an element with the same id as in the response must exist on the page if you d like to append any code to a page put in a placeholder for it any empty element for the same reason it s recommended to place messages in the ajaxoutput component as no messages is also a message if i can t do this what other approach would you suggest update i tried this on a page which has a rich tabpanel control set to ajax mode i made the first default one of the tab contents get the nested divs on dom ready via jquery it works fine the first time but when i click the other tabs and come back to the first one the extra divs don t appear i think this is because the js is fired only once at dom ready and then on richfaces rerendering of tabpanel control it rerenders as if it was unaware of the extra divs is there a way to avoid this >>> jquery html jsf richfaces facelets

genetic algorithms in games i have to do a term project on genetic algorithms and i had the idea of tuning the traits i e weapons to be used etc of a first person shooter bot for example i would represent the traits in the form of a string with first bits representing probability of choosing weapon next bits representing probability of choosing weapon etc i would thus get the optimal string and thus be able to figure out what should be the optimal set of weapons i should use the obvious problem that i am facing is how to find the fitness values my idea would be that if i want to find the fitness of a string i force the bot to use the corresponding weapons and play a game against it and use the final score of the bot as the fitness the problem is that i would need to play a large no of games is there some sort of simulation that i can do for example can i somehow get a function f where i would feed in the bot s traits ex weapons etc and it would return the corresponding fitness values do open source fps games provide such a library the other option would be to go into the source code of the game and then keep on simulating various scenarios and noting the score in each scenario i would prefer not to have the added complexity of going into the source of the game since this is a short month project thanks >>> genetic-algorithm

shared ptr magic mr lidstrm and me had an argument mr lidstrm s claim is that a construct shared ptr lt base gt p new derived doesn t require base to have a virtual destructor armen tsirunyan really will the shared ptr clean up correctly could you please in this case demonstrate how that effect could be implemented daniel lidstrm the shared ptr uses its own destructor to delete the concrete instance this is known as raii within the c community my advice is that you learn all you can about raii it will make your c coding so much easier when you use raii in all situations armen tsirunyan i know about raii and i also know that eventually the shared ptr destructor may delete the stored px when pn reaches but if px had static type pointer to base and dynamic type pointer to derived then unless base has a virtual destructor this will result in undefined behavior correct me if i am wrong daniel lidstrm the shared ptr knows the static type is concrete it knows this since i passed it in its constructor seems a bit like magic but i can assure you it is by design and extremely nice so judge us how is it possible if it is to implement shared ptr without requiring polymorphic classes to have virtual destructor thanks in advance >>> c++ destructor smart-pointers

how to do z ordering in software correctly i am rendering d objects on a d canvas by doing all necessary calculations in software i am not using graphics acceleration initially all the objects were cubes of same size so i could sort them based on their distance in z from camera and that would order them correctly but now i am trying to draw cubes of varying dimensions that makes my simple z ordering algorithm fail in perspective projection i looked into computer graphics books and found the techniques used they eventually recommend pixel based comparision of two polygons to determine which one is ahead of other probably that s what they do in graphics card but doing so in software seems overly difficult and i guess it will be slow for practical use even if i can do it is there a simple trick to do this in software any examples from early days of d graphics when graphics cards were not available although this is generic d graphics question if it helps i am doing this on top of html canvas d api >>> 3d

table schema design problem while using innodb i have encountered a problem when designing the table schema for our system here is the situation our system has a lot of items more than millions each item has an unique id but for each item there can be lots of records for example for the item with id there are about records and each record has more than attributes the needs to be identified by its id and status of one or more of its attributes for use in select update or delete i want to use innodb but the problem is when using innodb there must be an cluster index due to the situation described above it seems had to find a cluster index so i can only use an auto increment int as the key the current design is as follows create table record item key int unsigned not null auto increment item id int unsigned not null attribute char not null attribute int unsigned not null attribute int unsigned not null primary key `item key` key `iattribute ` `item id` `attribute ` key `iattribute ` `item id` `attribute ` engine innodb auto increment default charset latin the sql statement select from records where item id and attribute a and attribute between and the update and delete statement are similar i don t think this a good design but i can t think of anything else all suggestions welcome thank you very much sorry if i didn t make the question clear what i want to access select update delete insert is the records not the items the items have there own attributes but in the descritions above the attributes that i mentioned are belongs to the records every item can have many records like item have about records every record have attributes some of them can be null every record has an unique id this id is unique among different items but this id is an string not an number i want to access the records in this way a i will only get or update or delte the records that belongs to one specific item at on time or in one query b i will get or update the values of all attributes or some specific attributes in the query c the attributes that in the condition of the query may not the same as the attributes that i want so there could be some sql statements like select attribute attribute n from record table where item id and attribute k some value and attribute m between and and the reasons that why i think the original design is not good are i can t choose an attribute or the record id as the primary key because it is no use in every query i have to assign the item id and some attriubtes as the query condition like where item id and attribute value and attribte between and so i can only use an auto increment int number as the primary key the result of this is that each query have to scna two b trees and it look like that scan of the secondary index is not effective also compound keys seems useless because the condition of the query could vary among many attributes with the original design it seems that i have add a lot of indexs to satisfy different queries otherwise i have to deal with the full talbe scan problem but it is obviously that too many indexs is not good for update delete insert opertaions thank you again for your reply >>> mysql design table schema innodb

duplicate visual studio s memory violation detection on linux i developed a command line non gui c program on linux using qt creator which internally uses gdb as its debugger when i debugged the program on windows using visual studio it reported that it was writing outside the bounds of allocated memory although it did not report the violation at the exact time it occurred so it was still hard to track down i eventually managed to find a place in the code where a malloc call was allocating too little memory and that solved the problem however it bothers me that this problem was never detected on the linux side are there any switches or something that would enable this detection feature on linux >>> c linux visual-studio memory-management debugging

three different images for portrait and landscape orientation possible i am using three to present a photo essay of a story i made after the february earthquake in chile i would like the app to display portrait type images when ipad device is in portrait orientation and landscape type images when ipad device is in landscape orientation so there would be two versions of every image one cropped for portrait viewing and one cropped for landscape viewing and the app would show the version that is appropriate for the orientation the device is in i will crop these image versions separately that way the app would make full use of the screen in all orientations and users will read the story like a magazine ideally the view would change over to the corresponding image staying where it is in the sequence of images when the user rotates the device so from portrait # to landscape # and vice versa for example but if this is not possible jumping back to the first image whenever ipad device is rotated is acceptable as well push to separate ttimageviews maybe the idea is to give to user the experience he is reading an illustrated story in all orientations can this be done if so can you give some clues if it can not be done putting a specific image in the background with the image viewer overlaying it may also be a solution if separate fullscreen views for each orientation are not possible then at least i would like to get rid of the black autoresizing mask parts of the screen many thanks diederik >>> image orientation three20 swap uiinterfaceorientation

online app to rip discs to iso dmg i ve been thinking a lot lately about how cool it would be to have a website that allows a user to insert a disc into their drive and click a button to begin a ripping process after the rip is complete it would upload to a server and be hosted there ideally the process would be seamless for both dvds and cds and work cross platform my question is for the developers here what recommendations do you have on approaching this situation does it seem feasible is it something that would require a flex app java can the user get away with doing this in their browser only without having to download any software i d also like to make sure that if the upload disconnects during the uploading process the user can log back in and resume the upload where it failed i found some software that kind of achieves what i m looking to do but it is downloaded and is windows only as it relies on some dll files to complete the process i can show you this software if it would help for the record the dvds and cds uploaded would need to be legally owned and the uploader must have the copyright so don t think i m getting into any infringement or illegality issues thanks for the insight >>> java flex dvd cd ripping

magento when to pass variables to a block and when not to i have recently found the power of setting variables to a block in the tohtml method using the assign method my question is when is it good to do this and when is it not i am creating a new module and it seems to me it is much nice to just assign all the variables to the block and just reference those variables in the view file rather then setting up something like this lt php var this gt getvar var this gt getvar gt lt div id lt php echo var gt gt lt php echo var gt lt div gt isn t better to just set those in the block class and just call the variables in the phtml file then your template file would just look like lt div id lt php echo var gt gt lt php echo var gt lt div gt this would remove more php code being in the template which i think is good the only thing i can think of is it will be harder to know what variables are set when other developers are working on the template file if i put a comment at the top that all variables are mostly set in x block class that would help or if they are debugging they will see all the variables set but i guess it could still be confusing and i am assuming this is why magento has only did it sparingly but i am looking for anyone else s opinion on this for best practices >>> php zend-framework magento

is this a good reason to use a service bus alternatives please i m in the planning phase of our new site it s an extension of some mobile apps we ve built we want to provide our users with a central point for communication and also provide features for users who don t want to can t use the mobile apps one of the features we re looking at adding is a reputation system similar in nature to the so badge system we re designing the system to use soa i don t want to have to code all of this logic into the main app as discreet chunks i m thinking of creating a means to accomplish this which will allow us to define new thresholds and rules for gaining reputation and have them injected into some service the two ways i ve thought of doing this so far are to look for certain traits in a users actions and respond this would mean having a service running that can run through the plugged in award definitions and check for thresholds that have been met and respond appropriately to fire events when the user performs actions listen out for those events and respond appropriately because the services which will be carrying out these actions are running in separate app domains potentially on separate servers the only way i can see having a central message bus to listen and respond to these events is by using something like masstransit nservicebus or rhino esb i know that using a service bus can very easily be inappropriately designed into an application that simply doesn t need it and most times unless you re integrating disparate heterogenous systems you most likely won t need one when designing a new system but i m a bit lost for options as to the best way to do this i don t like the idea of having a service hammer the db all the time in the background but it does sound like it might be a lot simpler early on later on i dread to think has anyone here designed a system like this how did you accomplish this we re designing for high throughput as we expect there will be times when the system will need to be able to cope with bursts of users >>> asp.net-mvc design-patterns architecture esb

directx alpha blending deferred rendering i m having a major issue which has been bugging me for a while now my problem is my game uses a deferred rendering engine which makes it very difficult to do alpha blending the only way i can think of solving this issue is to render the scene including depth map normal map and diffuse map without any objects which have alphas then for each polygon which has a texture with an alpha component disable the z buffer and render it out including normals depth and colour and wherever alpha is don t output anything to the depth normal and colour buffer perform lighting calculations other deferred effects on these two separate textures then combine the colour buffers using the depth map to check for which pixel is visible this idea would be extremely costly not to mention has some severe short comings to do so obviously should only be reserved for as few cases as possible which makes rendering forest areas out of the question however if there is no better solution i have one question when doing alpha blending with directx is there a shader device state i can set which makes it so that i can avoid writing to the depth normal colour buffer when i want to the issue is the pixel shader has to output to all its render targets specified so if its set to output to the render targets it must do it which will override the previous colour value for that texel in the texture if there is no blend state which allows me to do this it would mean i would have to copy the normal texture and depth map to keep the scene and then render to a new texture depth and normal map then combine the two textures based on the alpha and depth values i guess really all i want toknow is if there is a simple sure fire and possibly cheap way to render alphas in a deferred renderer >>> graphics directx rendering blending

returning to development what tools languages frameworks techniques to learn i started my professional career in software development years ago yikes over the years my working life has moved to different areas project and program management consultancy solution architecture and so on i ve never totally given up programming but it s been minor bits of assistance for others rather than anything hardcore if i wanted to return to serious development what should i be studying and doing what tools are in the essential toolkit for a modern developer for instance i m only barely competent in eclipse and know nothing much about recent source code management or build tools what languages would repay study i ve been looking at scala which is interesting i m not really familiar with things like hibernate struts or spring another way of putting it might be what should be on the syllabus of my hypthetical self taught modern software development course initially i probably would put some time into assisting with some open source projects so things that would make me more useful for that preferred given i ve been knocking around the industry for many years i do have knowledge of a lot of technology independent software engineering topics so you can assume i m ok on algorithms etc and i have pretty good knowledge of c perl server side javascript and reasonable knowledge of xml lisp i know my way around unix >>> software-engineering

apc opcode cache vs user cache set separate limits i am trying to move from the typical combination of apc for opcode and memcache for my userdata to a purely apc based cache given my usage structure it makes sense and performance is higher but unlike before where the apc cache was limited to a reasonable size and did not affect my data cache i am now worried that the opcode cache might grow relatively large so that the sum of opcode cache an datacache exceeds the limit as far as i understand this would result in a flush of the total cache is there a way to mimic the behaviour as if apc was only an opcode cache and limit the opcode cache size to a reasonable limit leaving the rest for user data or should i try setting lower ttl values for the opcode cache so it always gets flushed first >>> php caching apc opcode-cache

detecting changes to a specific attribute of nsmanagedobject how can i detect changes to a specific attribute of an nsmanagedobject in my core data data model i have a product entity that represents a product for sale the product entity has several attributes price sku weight numberinstock etc whenever the price attribute of a product changes i need to perform a lengthy calculation consequently i would like to know when the price attribute of any product changes edit even if that change comes from merging a context saved on another thread what is a good way to go about doing this i have thousands of product objects in my store obviously it s not feasible to send each one an addobserver message i have been using nsmanagedobjectcontextobjectsdidchangenotification to detect changes but it only notifies me that a managed object has changed not which attribute of that object has changed i could redo the calculation whenever there s any change to a product but that results in useless recalculations whenever an irrelevant attribute has changed i m considering making a price entity that only contains a price attribute and using a to one relationship between product and price this way i can detect changes to price objects in order to kick off the calculation this seems excessively kludgy to me is there a better way update railwayparade pointed out that i could use the changedvalues method of nsmanagedobject to determine which properties have changed for each updated object i completely missed that method and it would totally solve my problem if the changes weren t being made on a background thread and merged into the main thread s context see next paragraph i completely missed a subtlety about the way that nsmanagedobjectcontextobjectsdidchangenotification works as far as i can tell when a managed object context saved on another thread is merged into a context on the main thread using a mergechangesfromcontextdidsavenotification the resulting nsmanagedobjectcontextobjectsdidchangenotification only contains change information about objects that are currently in the main thread s managed object context if a changed object isn t in the main thread s context it won t be part of the notification it makes sense but wasn t what i was anticipating therefore my thought of using a to one relationship instead of an attribute in order to get more detailed change information actually requires examination of the background thread s nsmanagedobjectcontextdidsavenotification not the main thread s nsmanagedobjectcontextobjectsdidchangenotification of course it would be much smarter to simply use the changedvalues method of nsmanagedobject as railwayparade helpfully pointed out however i m still left with the problem that the change notification from the merge on the main thread won t necessarily contain all of the changes made on the background thread >>> iphone core-data notifications nsmanagedobject

proper table schema i have a project that i am working on and i can t figure out which would be a better table relationship schema the scope of the area in question are user uploads documents become the owner author user can share document with other users set share rights any user who has access to document can checkout the document exclusive lock my original schema looks like this benefits are only one user can be author authorid rights table contain only sharerights read write user has easy distinction as to which files they own authorid vs sharedfiles sharedfiles table this one is a weak benefit i know after thinking things through i thought that this might be a better schema benefits are all document associations are located in one location userfiles future ability to allow multiple authors owner of a single document rights table would now have read write and owner as soon as a document was uploaded by a user an automatic association would be made to a new document and the user would be given owner rights this led me to the final schema benefits are if a user file association is removed removed share and that user had a lock on the file checked out then that exclusive lock would be automatically removed the only problem with this last model is that i plan to add special user for each department so that a user could share a document to an entire department so i am not sure if i want to associate the share association to the checkoutid if that makes sense the query for the users files would look like select all files where userfiles userid me userid userfiles id specialdepid amp amp me depid specialdepid major pseudo code it has been a long time since i have done database schemas and this one design decision is really racking my brain it is really bugging me as to which design would be better and by better i mean better design principles better decision based off of previous experience allows for easier growth in the design etc please let me know your thoughts thanks final solution with the help from michael madsen the final solution looks like there will be a trigger on userfiles for delete which will determine if a lock should be deleted when a relationship is removed >>> sql-server design schema table database-schema

how to support recursive include when parsing xml i m defining an xml schema of my own which supports the additional tag insert tag which when reached should insert the text file at that point in the stream and then continue the parsing here is an example my xml lt xml gt something lt insert file name foo html gt or another lt xml gt i m using xmlreader as follows class htmlhandler xml sax handler contenthandler def init self xml sax handler contenthandler init self parser xml sax make parser parser setcontenthandle htmlhandler parser parse stringio html the question is how do i insert the included contents directly into the parsing stream of course i could recursively build up the non interpolated text by repeatedly inserting included text but that means that i have to parse the xml multiple times i tried replacing stringio html with my own stream that allows inserting contents mid stream but it doesn t work because the sax parser reads the stream buffered update i did find a solution that is hackish at the best it is built on the following stream class class insertreader a reader class that supports the concept of pushing another reader in the middle of the use of a first reader this may be used for supporting insertion commands def init self self reader stack def push self reader self reader stack reader def pop self self reader stack pop def iter self return self def read self n read from the top most stack element never trancends elements should it the code below is a hack it feeds only a single token back to the reader while len self reader stack # return a single token ret text stringio state while c self reader stack read if c break ret text write c if c break ret text ret text getvalue if ret text self reader stack pop continue return ret text return def next self while len self reader stack try v self reader stack next except stopiteration self reader stack pop continue return v raise stopiteration this class creates a stream structure that restricts the amount of characters that are returned to the user of the stream i e even if the xml parser does read the class will only return bytes up to the next character since the character also signifies the end of tags we have the opportunity to inject our recursive include into the stream at this point what is hackish about this solution is the following reading one character at a time from a stream is slow this has an implicit assumption about how the sax stream class is reading text this solves the problem for me but i m still interested in a more beautiful solution >>> python xml

fast undo redo for bitmap editor when memory is limited i m trying to write a bitmap editor for a mobile device i e a limited version of photoshop the user s document consists of bitmaps around x in size each i want a robust and efficient undo redo system that s as simple as possible i m aiming for about s to undo or redo an edit i m looking for some feedback on my current intended approach or for some new ideas i can use i think what i have is too complex so i m cautious about proceeding so just knowing it s about the best i could do would be good i ve experimented with combinations of using the command pattern and the memento pattern for my undo redo system some conclusions i ve come to so far are i don t have enough memory and i cannot write memory to disk fast enough to use a memento to support an unexecute operation on the previous command in many situations e g if the user does several individual paint strokes very quickly i won t be able to store bitmaps that represent what the user painted over without making the user wait for them to be saved if i restore the document to its initial state and replay all the commands except for the last one to implement undo this is far too slow after even a modest number of commands e g replaying paint strokes or smudge strokes takes s which is too sluggish i can get around the previous point by saving the whole document in the background periodically to disk and restoring to this checkpoint before playing back commands to undo further back than the last checkpoint we reload the checkpoint before this and replay the commands approach with works ok except saving the entire document gets slower and slower as more layers are added and it s already slow with bitmaps seconds wait i therefore need to modify so that i only save what has changed since last time since many commands operate on only one layer it makes sense to only save the layers that have been modified since the last checkpoint for example my command stack might look like this if i have initial layers where i ve indicated where checkpoints might be saved checkpoint save layer and paint on layer paint on layer checkpoint save layer reuse saved layers and from checkpoint paint on layer paint on layer checkpoint save layer reuse saved layers and from checkpoint paint on layer paint on layer flip layer horizontally checkpoint save layer reuse saved layers and from checkpoint resize layer and checkpoint save layer during editing i keep track of which layers have been modified since the previous checkpoint when i restore a checkpoint i only restore the layers that have changed e g to restore checkpoint after modifying layer and i reload the backups of layer and from disk when adding a checkpoint i save only the layer that has been modified so far i can make all this mostly automatic except there needs to be places in my interface where the user is forced to wait for checkpoints to be saved because i can only keep about temporary copy of a layer in memory at a time what do you think it s much more complex than i d like it to be but i can t see any other way are there any other useful patterns i can use to make my life easier >>> algorithm design-patterns optimization undo

javascript in internet explorer how to do something after a variable is loaded registered i m using some jquery that works fine in all browsers except in internet explorer and probably not the earlier versions although i m not as worried about those i m using jquery s each function to loop over every element in a javascript array that is auto generated on my page by the fairly inflexible cms i m using for example my cms writes this array of image objects in javascript to my page paths paths new image paths src path to image paths new image paths src path to image paths new image paths src path to image paths new image paths src path to image i then am using jquery each function to loop over this array and return all images in a nice little unordered list the problem is that while using jquery s document ready function is working fine in ff safari chrome etc and actually able to render my unordered list pretty much immediately internet explorer seems run my document ready function before it registers that the paths array exists in javascript even though this jquery is included after the code for the image array i know this because i m thrown an paths is null undefined error in ie when i changed it from document ready function to window load function my code worked as it should in ie because it only executes my jquery each function after the entire page is loaded which sucks because it slows down render time and causes a lag in what i m trying to do but hey if it works however its appearing that ie sometimes still fires off my each function while using window load before it registers that an array named paths exists if the website has been cached would anyone know a sure fire way to ensure that the paths variable is registered by ie immediately so my each function doesn t fail >>> javascript jquery internet-explorer document-ready

illegal mix of collations error from mysql while running rails test suite i ve recently dusted off an old ruby on rails project of mine in the past i ve never had any problems getting all the tests to pass but now there is one test that gives me the following error activerecord statementinvalid mysql error #hy illegal mix of collations latin swedish ci implicit and utf general ci coercible for operation select from cards where cards l description and cards l word so i go to my test db and ask mysql gt use flashcard test reading table information for completion of table and column names you can turn off this feature to get a quicker startup with a database changed mysql gt show full columns from cards field type collation null key default extra privileges comment id int null no pri null auto increment select insert update references l word varchar latin swedish ci yes null select insert update references l description text latin swedish ci yes null select insert update references l id int null yes null select insert update references l id int null yes null select insert update references rows in set sec and as you can see the collation is latin swedish ci and presumably if it were utf general ci my problems would be solved thankfully my development database is already okay so i go and rake db test clone structure and back to mysql and check again in the test db mysql gt show full columns from cards field type collation null key default extra privileges comment id int null no pri null auto increment select insert update references l word varchar utf general ci yes null select insert update references l description text utf general ci yes null select insert update references l id int null yes null select insert update references l id int null yes null select insert update references rows in set sec ah so now everything is looking good so once again i rake test but i get the same problem all over again and when i check my test db i find that the collation column has been reset to latin swedish ci i do not understand very well how rake test works but my working hypothesis is that it recreates the db using schema rb now in one of my migrations i ve got class createcards lt activerecord migration def self up create table cards options gt default character set utf collate utf general ci do t t column english word string t column chinese description text end end def self down drop table cards end end and this apparently has taken care of the collate problem there i ve got another migration which renames english word and chinese description to l word and l description respectively but this information has not made it into schema rb and somehow apparently mysql has decided to assume that i want latin swedish ci so to summarize what i think i need to do is somehow edit something so that i ll be using the utf general ci collation and then my problems will go away right but i cannot figure out how to make the code that gets run when you rake test do this can anybody help for what it s worth both the test and development databases were created as create database flashcard test default character set utf default collate utf general ci and create database flashcard development default character set utf default collate utf general ci and my database yml has development adapter mysql database flashcard development username root password encoding utf test adapter mysql database flashcard test username root password encoding utf collation utf general ci http nhw pl wp mysql collate setting in rails application seems to suggest that this problem has something to do with the connection between ror and mysql but i haven t had any luck with the suggestions there >>> mysql ruby-on-rails collation

how to reposition css hover popups to stay within a fixed frame i have a page filled with many fixed size boxes in a grid layout div s simply piled up with float left on hovering the mouse on any of them a popup larger div with the same and also additional info is shown over it as if the box expanded in all directions but not moving the other boxes it s shown also over them simplified html css below it s like thumbnails full images but the actual content is a pile of various html data including links etc the problem is that in this way the popup div for the leftmost rightmost boxes goes over the screen triggering the scrollbar or they are cut off if i don t allow the overflow i would like instead to reposition these popups to left right so that they stay within the total borders how to approach this need i can t do this server side as the server does not know which boxes will be rightmost leftmost it depends on window size how many columns will fit there my first idea is to use javascript to change the positioning for all the popups right after the page is loaded but i don t know how to a find out which popups would be sticking out of the frame and even b find out the size of the popups since they are hidden normally which means width height until they are shown perhaps a completely different approach of showing these popups would be easier than repositioning the div s that i currently have currently prototype scriptaculous is used at some other pages the server side is ruby on rails lt div class frame gt lt div class box id object gt small fixed size content here lt div class popup gt large variable size width height content here that describes object lt div gt lt div gt lt div class box id object gt small fixed size content here lt div class popup gt large variable size width height content here that describes object lt div gt lt div gt many other similar boxes lt div gt div frame overflow hidden div box border px solid #efe dc margin px position relative float left height px width px div popup min width px display none position absolute left px top px z index div box hover popup display block >>> javascript css

best implementation for a callback method to update multiple fields i am developing a mobile application blackberry with java that makes use of the google translate api i have it set up so that a user can specify a language before logging in and then once they log in i have wrappers around every piece of text displayed to screen which will translate the text based on the language chosen my problem is that multiple things need to be translated on a given screen therefore i have to access the google translate api multiple times per screen to do this i open an httpconnection on a new thread so i pass my screen interface to the translator class and then the translator class will call my callback methods for that screen requestsucceeded or requestfailed now lets say i translate both the screen title and the screen body text that s two separate httpconnections so when the title is translated i want my requestsucceeded method to settext on my title labelfield when the body text is translated i want my requestsucceeded method to settext on my body labelfield what is the best way to have my requestsucceeded method differentiate between different fields to be updated currently i am passing to the translator two things via a string array the text to be translated and a cookie describing the item being translated i then use if statements in my requestsucceeded callback method to update the appropriate field based on the cookie which the translator will send back along with the translated text i feel like there has to be a better way to do all of this does anyone have any suggestions thanks >>> java blackberry mobile methods callback

non blocking native files access single threaded daemon in c i ve found out that native files access has no non blocking state i m correct i ve been googling for daemons which are non blocking and i ve found one which achieved said behavior by threading file access operations so that the daemon won t block my question is wouldn t threading and ipc ing such operations be rather expensive wouldn t it make more sense to either a pre thread pool simply have each client at a thread and let it block for which ever blocking operations it might need or b in case of file access blocking use a relatively small buffer that way it s still blocking but one would assume that a tiny buffer for multiple operations would make more sense than paying the price of threading each operation and ipc it >>> c multithreading daemon nonblocking

are auto generated proxies the best approach for implementing an asynchronous wcf client i am designing the architecture for a c# net project that will communicate between a client and a server via wcf this will generally be a query response system so as an example one of the service methods might look like this user getuserbylastname string lastname an additional stipulation is that the wcf client methods need to be invoked asynchronously so they don t adversely affect the responsiveness of the ui as these methods may take significant time to execute in some cases i have a proof of concept in place that i have implemented according to microsoft s documentation so client proxies are automatically generated using the add service reference dialog in visual studio and i check the option to include asynchronous methods this works fine as a proof of concept but i have encountered numerous blog posts and other references that strongly recommend against the use of auto generated proxies in a large scale project several of these sources present alternatives involving manually creating proxies or dynamically creating proxies using reflection but these solutions seem to invariably only implement synchronous wcf calls an auto generated proxy for an asynchronous wcf client involves quite a bit of boiler plate code that i would hate to have to manually implement and maintain for each service and method so my question is is it a bad idea to use auto generated proxies for asynchronous wcf services and if so is there a good alternative that does not involve significant manual maintenance of boiler plate code >>> c# .net wcf

what are methods of programmatically detecting many to many relationships in a rdmbs i m currently busy making a python orm which gets all of its information from a rdbms via introspection i would go with xrecord if i was happy with it in other respects meaning the end user only tells which tables views to look at and the orm does everything else automatically if it makes you actually write something and you re not looking for weird things and dangerous adventures it s a bug the major part of that is detecting relationships provided that the database has all relevant constraints in place and you have no naming conventions at all i want to be able to have this orm work with a database made by any crazy dba which has his own views on what the columns and tables should be named like and i m stuck at many to many relationships first there can be compound keys then there can be mtm relationships with three or more tables then a mtm intermediary table might have its own data apart from keys some data common to all tables it ties together what i want is a method to programmatically detect that a table x is an intermediary table tying tables a and b and that any non key data it has must belong to both a and b and if i change a common attribute from within a it should affect the same attribute in b are there common algorithms to do that or at least to make guesses which are right in of the cases provided the dba is sane >>> python orm metaprogramming introspection relationships

combining list boxes into rich text boxes another homework assignment here thats kind of unclear on the requirements it is a forms program that assigns people to seats on an airplane the part that is losing me is that its telling me to display the passenger manifest in a list box but then its telling me to display it in a list box then it calls it a rich text box again the screenshots provided with the assignment only show one display box one of the events that is supposed to be included is a double click on an item in the manifest display when the flight is closed it tallies up your first class and business class passengers and displays that info in the same display box so my question is was list box somehow incorporated into the rich text box i thought maybe it was just overlayed but later screenschots show the display box filled and scrolled down as if it were all the same text box rather than just a list box or rich text i m confused obviously i m not looking for anyone to do my work for me but it doesn t appear this was covered in our material online class so i don t get a lot of instructor feedback on stuff like this unfortunately can anyone offer to shed any light on this >>> c# winforms listbox richtextbox

platform invoke bool and string suppose a dll contains the following functions extern c declspec dllexport void f bool x do something extern c declspec dllexport const char g do something else my first naive approach to use these functions from c# was as follows dllimport mydll dll internal static extern void f bool x dllimport mydll dll internal static extern string g the first surprise was that c bool doesn t convert into c# bool strange runtime behavior but no crashes though so i had to change bool to byte and convert from one to another by hand so first question is is there any better way to marshal bool note that this is bool not bool the second surprise was that the raw string returned by the dll function was owned by the c# string not copied as i would expect and eventually the c# code frees the memory returned by the dll i found this out because the program crashed but then i changed the return type to sbyte and manually initialized the string with that pointer which already does the copy so the second question is is there any better way to prevent the marshalled string from owning the pointer wtf why does c# do that i mean an obvious case is when the dll func returns a literal and c# tries to delete it thanks in advance and hopefully my questions aren t vague or incomprehensible >>> c# c++ c interop marshalling

virus signatures and genetic algorithms i would like to know how one achieves the following signature i have read online that al least in the past researchers will take the suspected file the binary code convert it to assembly examine it pick sections of code that appear to be unusual and identifying the corresponding bytes in the machine code but then how is the bellow virus string signature achieved mirc julie e e b a c e f c a c c a e f d a d e d d a d e d a d e d a e a f e e b a c e f c a c c a also although this might sound completely crazy that string above must mean something i can only guess a sequence of actions actual code etc so if it was once translated in this form virus signature from assembly is it possible to convert it back just in case you might wonder why am asking what even i think is a weird question this is why i am preparing my bsc final year computer science project and at this point i am wondering whether it would be possible to maybe generate estimate evaluate predict virus signatures by using ga s genetic algorithms maybe that will help make my question a bit easier to understand i hope thanks >>> genetic-algorithm evolutionary-algorithm virus-definitions

how to choose a research discipline in computer science i got my bachelor s degree in cs five years ago and after that i ve been working as software engineer building voice over ip voip or video surveillance system but now for some personal reason i feel that i would like go back to get a phd degree but now the problem is i am not quite sure which branch of computer science i should choose as most of my working experience is related to multimedia perhaps professors who study that would be more willing to accept my application however i am not quite sure if multimedia is still popular research domain in north america and if there are not too much works left in this domain what are other possible choices i am also interested in programming languages but i don t know if programming languages could be considered a research area another important question is after i have decided in which domain i would like to study how can i find most influential research results in this area to get an overview of it in other words since there must be plenty of papers in a domain how can i know which i should read btw if you happened to be a phd student in computer science what kind of skills or personality do you think your professors prefer this last question might be too subjective so please ignore it if you feel it s ridiculous thanks a lot >>> computer-science

no base classes of the same type as the first non static data member i asked this a while ago on comp std c and got no reply i m just going to quote my post there with little modification is the last requirement of standard layout classes necessary or useful a footnote explanation is provided this ensures that two subobjects that have the same class type and that belong to the same most derived object are not allocated at the same address taken alone the footnote is incorrect two empty base classes with a common base class may produce two instances of the base class at the same address struct a struct b a struct c a struct d b c d d static cast lt a gt static cast lt b gt amp d static cast lt a gt static cast lt c gt amp d allowed per taken in the context of subobjects are only mentioned in the comparison requirements of pointers to members base subobjects are irrelevant moreover it doesn t make sense to give special status to comparison between a scalar pointer to a member subobject and a pointer to a base subobject above that of comparison between pointers to base subobjects there wasn t such a restriction in c even if there is an abi out there that requires every member to be allocated at a different address from any base of the same type yet already allows the empty base class optimization on the above code i think the abi is buggy and the standard shouldn t capture this the language goes back to n which suggests that multiple inheritance might cause trouble and need to be disallowed in standard layout classes to ensure abi compatibility however that was ultimately allowed and in that light the requirement doesn t make sense for reference unless it is a bit field a most derived object shall have a non zero size and shall occupy one or more bytes of storage base class subobjects may have zero size an object of trivially copyable or standard layout type shall occupy contiguous bytes of storage unless an object is a bit field or a base class subobject of zero size the address of that object is the address of the first byte it occupies two distinct objects that are neither bit fields nor base class subobjects of zero size shall have distinct addresses footnote under the as if rule an implementation is allowed to store two objects at the same machine address or not store an object at all if the program cannot observe the difference additional notes refers to the same mystery content at but it s also just an informative note note a base class subobject may be of zero size clause however two subobjects that have the same class type and that belong to the same most derived object must not be allocated at the same address end note gcc appears to guarantee that empty base subobjects of the same type are given unique addresses example program and output this seems sufficient to guarantee that objects of a given type are uniquely identified by address that would be above and beyond the guarantees of the c object model of course this is a good idea but it doesn t seem required by the standard likewise the platform abi can extend this guarantee to a class with the first member aliasing an empty base the language sets minimum requirements for abis an abi can add a language feature and other abis can follow suit and the process of catch up by the standard is simply error prone my question is whether the given requirement accomplishes anything in the context of the standard not whether it is useful to the user in concert with other abi guarantees evidence that such a unique address guarantee was intended and only omitted by accident would also make the requirement more meaningful to summarize the answer or my conclusion anyway the requirement does not theoretically ensure anything as it s possible anyway to ensure that all objects of a given type have different addresses when the address of an empty base class subobject conflicts with another object either another base or a member the compiler may simply assign it an arbitrary location within the structure as the standard layout rules only describe the locations of data members possibly inherited the locations of empty bases are still unspecified and perhaps incompatible between similar standard layout classes the locations of non empty bases are still unspecified as far as i ve noticed and then it s not clear what is meant by first member in that case but they must be consistent in any case in practice the requirement allows implementations to continue using existing abis so long as they include the empty base class optimization existing compilers may disable the ebo when the requirement is violated to avoid the address of the base coinciding with the address of the first member if the standard didn t restrict programs this way libraries and programs would have to be recompiled with updated c x compilers not worth it >>> c++ struct c++11

select a wpf uielement in a flowdocument i have a flowdocument inside a richtextbox that contains uielement controls such as checkbox es i need the user to be able to click on the checkbox to select it to change the controls properties such as label background color etc the problem i have is that when i click it it only checks or unchecks the checkbox as you would expect how would i have the checkbox display a border around itself when clicked on and not change the checked value making the isenabled property false means that i can t even access the control at all it is not recognised i guess the simplest explanation of what i am trying to achieve is similar to expression blend or visual studio visual designer when the user clicks a checkbox it gets selected rather than the checked value toggling i have tried searching all over for this but don t know what direction to proceed any help would be appreciated >>> c# wpf checkbox flowdocument uielement

logic for software verification i m looking at the requirements for automated software verification i e a program that takes in code ordinary procedural code written in languages like c and java generates a bunch of theorems saying that each loop must eventually halt no assertion will be violated there will never be a dereference of a null pointer etc then passes same to a theorem prover to prove they are actually true or else find a counterexample indicating a bug in the code the question is what kind of logic to use the two major positions seem to be first order logic is just fine first order logic isn t expressive enough you need higher order logic problem is there seems to be a lot of support for both positions so which one is right if it s the second one are there any available examples of things you want to do that verifiers based on first order logic have trouble with >>> logic verification formal-methods
richfaces application should i use rich datatable or jqgrid pros cons following on from here i need to have an inline editable grid in my web application using richfaces jsf and facelets my options are the rich datatable richfaces control or the jquery plugin jqgrid i have tried both and found the following so far jqgrid works really well but i am not sure what will happen if i try to refresh jsf controls from the grid if that s possible i am hesitant to use or trigger richfaces modal windows from the jqgrid can this cause problems or should i stick to plain jquery modals to be safe using the jqgrid it looks like i have to do a lot of my own plumbing losing the benefits of richfaces controls am i right rich datatable does not have a scrollable table with the headers fixed richfaces has a scrollable table but making that support inline editing has issues headers dissapear and editing does not work properly rich datatable is not very customizable and is missing some very nice to have features that jqgrid has rich datatable has some issues that seem unresolvable or will need js hacking eg making a row editable on single click instead of the default double click causes issues if you use a calendar control inside the editable row one click inside the calendar control fires an edit event again on the row making you lose your changes in other fields in addition to some of the questions above i would like to know what are the pros cons of each and what approach would be easier to maintain and extend and complete in the long run >>> jsp jsf jqgrid richfaces facelets

how do i configure iis to allow a remote database connection from within an isapi web server i have a native web service application isapi that i have built with delphi at this time it only exposes two methods the first one echostring is designed to give me feedback that the web service is functioning properly and it adds a couple characters to the string that i send to it from my delphi web service client this always works fine the second exposed method is the one that i am really interested in i pass this method a string that contains the xml contents of a clientdataset from the server side my code takes this xml and inserts it into a clientdataset after which it posts this data to a server side database i am using ibexpress components ibdatabase ibtransaction ibquery etc to connect to an interbase database on the server side the problem is that as soon as i attempt to connect the ibdatabase component to its database the web method fails i think i have ruled out all other sources for this error i can create and populate the clientdataset with a rather large clientdataset s xml sent from the client that includes nested datasets with no problems i am using the midaslib unit so the clientdataset is not trying to load a dll i can create and configure short of connecting to the ibdatabase and its various components again with no problems as soon as i set the ibdatabase component s connected property to true from within the web service it fails i am running iis under windows bit ultimate on my development machine i have tried granting full control rights to everyone as well as specifically to iis iusrs to both the specific isapi dll as well as to the entire directory in which the web service resides this did not solve the problem i suspect that this is entirely a privileges issue with iis what can i do to permit my isapi web service to connect to the interbase client api so that i can use the web service to write to my database server post script it appears that connecting to interbase from the web service is not the problem i am still tracking down the precise cause but i have now been able to successfully connect to interbase from within the web service i ll update this post once i know the cause but this question is no longer valid i am marking bob s answer as the correct one the connection string was wrong actually and this is embarrasing but i d rather be embarrassed than misleading i got bit by a with clause i stored my connection information in resource strings i made the assignment in a with clause the name of the resource string for the databasename property was databasename the with clause caused the databasename property to be assigned to itself instead of the value in the resource string i fixed the problem by prefacing the databasename resource string with the unit name ie databasename ibmodunit databasename >>> web-services delphi iis-7 isapi interbase

error message when populating cell in d numpy array i am trying to populate data from some csv files into a numpy array with the following code preexarray zeros len testids numcolumns float for row in reader if row preex secondsbefore preexarray j row however the last line of code above throws the following error valueerror setting an array element with a sequence so i printed out the contents of row as follows print row is row this produced row is so the contents of row are not a sequence as the error message indicates instead the contents are a number therefore i used to following code to put the contents of row into a variable then populate preexarray j with the contents of that variable and then print out the contents of that variable jones row preexarray j jones print preexarray j is preexarray j the result is preexarray j is so putting row into a variable solves the problem but this is really sloppy code if i have to put it into a variable every time can anyone show me how to fix the code so that it does not throw an error when i type something a lot simpler like preexarray j row ok i re wrote the code and now it is throwing a new error the new code is as follows preexarray zeros len testids numcolumns float for row in reader if row preex secondsbefore preexarray j row preexarray j row this revised code now throws the following error message preexarray j row valueerror setting an array element with a sequence however when i comment out preexarray j row as follows #preexarray j row the subsequent lines run without throwing an error can anyone tell me how to edit this so that it does not continue to throw this error >>> python arrays numpy 2d

counter cache not decrementing for has many associations in activereord my rails app has models and a third that s join table between them and their has many relationships basically user and show are joined by savedshow allowing users to save a list of shows class show lt activerecord base has many saved shows has many users through gt saved shows end class user lt activerecord base has many saved shows has many shows through gt saved shows end class savedshow lt activerecord base belongs to user counter cache gt saved shows count belongs to show end i ve noticed that the counter cache field shows saved count gets incremented automatically just fine but not decremented the core of the issue seems to be that removing shows from a user s list is done via delete which does not trigger updating of the counter cache current user shows delete show however i can t call the destroy method here since that not only deleted the user show association in savedshow but also the show object itself which is not what i want is a counter cache in this kind of scenario not an appropriate use there appears to be a discussion about this as a bug back in and fixes were discussed but i m still seeing the issue in the latest rails i would just write my own custom handling in the model but there seems to be no after delete callback that i can hook into presumably this is the reason decrementing doesn t work in the first place right now there s only one place in my own code where a delete of the association could occur so i ll just manually make a call to update the counter but this seems like like such a fundamental shortcoming or bug of acticerecord associations with counter cache that i m wondering if i m not just missing something if this is indeed a genuine problem with counter caches what would be the best workaround >>> ruby-on-rails activerecord counter-cache

how do i mock entity framework s navigational property intelligence i m attempting to test my repository using an in memory mock context i implement this with an in memory dictionary as most people do this implements members on my repository interface to add remove find etc working with the in memory collection this works fine in most scenarios testmethod public void canaddpost irepository lt post gt repo new mockrepository lt post gt repo add new post title foo var postjustadded repo find t gt t title foo singleordefault assert isnotnull postjustadded passes however i have the following test which i cannot get to pass with the mock repository works fine for the sql repository consider i have three repositories posts handles user content posts like a stackoverflow question locations locations in the world like los angeles locationposts junction table to handle many many between posts locations posts can be added to nowhere or they can also be added with a particular location now here s my test testmethod public void canaddposttolocation var location locationrepository findsingle get la var post new post title foo location location create post with la as location postrepository add post add post to repository var allpostsforlocation locationpostrepository findall get all la posts assert istrue allpostsforlocation contains post works for ef fails for mock basically when using the real ef sql repository when i add a post to a particular location entityframework is smart enough to add the locationpost record because of the association in the edmx locationposts navigational property on post entity but how can i make my mock repository smart enough to mimic this ef intelligence when i do add on my mock repository this just adds to the dictionary it has no smarts to go oh wait you have a dependant association let me add that to the other repository for you my mock repository is generic so i dont know how to put the smarts in there i have also looked at creating a fakeobjectcontext fakeobjectset as advised by julie lerman on her blog but this still does not cover this scenario i have a feeling my mocking solution isn t good enough can anyone help or provide an up to date article on how to properly mock an entity framework sql server repository covering my scenario the core of the issue is i have one repository per aggregate root which is fine but is also my downfall so post and location are both aggregate roots but neither own the locationposts therefore they are seperate repositories and in an in memory scenario they are seperate dictionaries i think i m missing the glue between them in my in memory repo edit part of the problem is that i am using pure poco s no ef code generation i also do not have any change tracking no snapshot based tracking no proxy classes i am under the impression this is where the smarts happen at the moment i am exploring a delegate option i am exposing a event in my generic mock repository void accepts generic t being the entity which i invoke after add i then subscribe to this event in my post repository where i plan to add the related entities to the other repositories this should work will put as answer if it does so however im not sure it this is the best solution but then again this is only to satisfy mocking code won t be used for real functionality >>> c# unit-testing mocking entity-framework-4 repository

standard sorting networks for small values of n i m looking for a sorting network implementation of a element sort but since i couldn t find a good reference on so i d like to ask for sorting networks for all small values of n at least n through n but higher values would be great too a good answer should at least list them as sequences of swap sort on elements operations but it might also be nice to see the recursive decomposition in terms of lower order sorting networks for my application i actually only care about the median of elements not actually putting them in order that is the order of the other elements may be unspecified in the result as long as the median ends up in the right place can a sorting networks related approach be used to compute the median with fewer swaps than performing a full sort if so such a solution to my problem for n and for other cases would make a great answer too note i ve tagged this question c because c is the language i use and i suspect people who follow the c tag have good answers but i don t really care if an answer is actually written in c versus pseudo code as long as it easily translates to c which it should naturally do as long as the above mentioned criteria are met >>> c sorting median

starting a cocoa document based application shows selection window first this seems like it should be easy yet i must be missing something i have a document based application i have also built a new xib that has a nstableview and three buttons on it that i intend to display a list of previous files i wish this xib to be displayed instead of the document window when the application first starts once the user selects an old file or hits the new button i wish to then go to the document window this is very common and i ve seen used quite often in my attempts to get this working i have modified the project info plist file and changed the main nib file base name from mydocument to my selection xib name this causes the application to display the selection window instead of the mydocument window there seems to be no problem up to this point in my selection window i have set up my table view and an array controller and a custom window controller just for this xib i have set the file s owner to the new window controller and bound the window controller s window property to the window and the window s delegate property to the file s owner as well as the select cancel and new buttons nothing is bound to nsapplication but the strange thing is when i run this application it seems to want to connect these controllers to nsapplication with the error same for the other two buttons could not connect the action selectbutton to target of class nsapplication it also displays an error that nsapplication is not key value compliant for the outlet that holds reference to my array the array controller window and buttons are not bound to nsapplication but to the new window controller i would have expected that if there was any problem is would not mention nsapplication but rather the window controller to which the controllers are bound anyone know what is happening here is this a target action problem because i changed the main nib file base name from main menu to selection if i am not supposed to change this then how can i get cocoa allow me to display a selection screen before showing the document window any help is greatly appreciated rob >>> cocoa xib cocoa-bindings document-based
ruby oauth nightmare using contacts api i ve been spending the last few days banging my head against the wall on supporting the ability to add a contact to the google contacts api in my rails application despite many false starts i ve finally made some progress by employing the ruby oauth gem and following the tutorial here http everburning com news google analytics oauth and ruby oh my when i follow this in the console i get further than i do in my rails app i can create an access token authenticate against google s service with the specific scope of the contacts api and apply the oauth verifier token to get an access token but when it comes time to push the data i get this error response at post https www google com m feeds contacts default full gdata gt # lt net httpunauthorized unknown authorization header readbody true gt where does the readbody true header come from and how would i get rid of it but it s worse in the rails app i have one controller action googlecontacts that creates the request token and leads the user to the authentication site with google def googlecontacts card card find by short link params id consumer oauth consumer new anonymous anonymous site gt https www google com request token path gt accounts oauthgetrequesttoken access token path gt accounts oauthgetaccesstoken authorize path gt accounts oauthauthorizetoken signature method gt hmac sha oauth version gt request token consumer get request token oauth callback gt http monkey dev cards google auth redir card short link scope gt https www google com m feeds session request token request token redirect to request token authorize url end this appears to work i get a working request token object and the user is forwarded to the google service to authenticate the callback url google auth should take the oauth verifier token to create an access token here s the beginning of the controller def google auth access token session request token get access token oauth verifier gt params oauth verifier and here s where it craps out the error on that last line is you have a nil object when you didn t expect it you might have expected an instance of array the error occurred while evaluating nil but the values that are in there the session request token and the params oauth verifier are present and accounted for in that action i can t figure out what is nil here so i guess i need to figure out this second problem first but bonus points for answering the first problem as well thanks for reading aaron >>> ruby-on-rails ruby oauth oauth-ruby

externally add form errors in django i have a django form that will add an entry to a database with a unique constraint on one of the columns if the submission happens to attempt creation of a duplicate i get a django db utls integrityerror stating i violated the unique constraint thankfully when processing django forms there are a number of ways to validate override the form class clean method override the form class clean lt field gt method if the clear lt field gt method raises a django forms validationerror the error message will be appended to a list in the errors dictionary under the field s name when using the clean method errors should be manually inserted into the errors dict now the clean and clean lt field gt methods don t sound like a nice place to put code that has side effects and i fear that checking at this moment whether the value is unique does not guarantee i won t get integrityerror s i would prefer to actually try and create the row in the database and signal a form error when a constraint is violated my main problem is that forms expose a public property errors which is read only therefore i should according to the docs add a method in my form that does all the work try to insert in the database and register an error when an integrityerror is raised because the action that processes the form after validation requires lots of other data i don t want to put the code inside the form class itself is there any other documented or not way to go about adding an entry in the errors dict from outside the class or should i simply access the errors private variable and be happy with that i know this sounds like an oop breach but creating an extra method just to access this private variable does not seem to me like it shields anybody from anything edit seems like someone else already raised a similar question but it seems the answers pointed to manual insertion into errors >>> django django-forms

iphone signing conceptual question why is ad hoc deployment needed i must be missing something conceptually here and i m hoping someone can set me straight i m not really clear why ad hoc deployments of iphone applications are necessary and why development builds can t be used instead specifically i don t understand why i can t just send someone my development provisioning profile and my app as long as their machine id is included in my development provisioning profile so on the apple provisioning portal under devices i add the device id of my iphone and that of my friend under certificates i submit a csr which to my understanding does not contain anything specific about my device it writes a private key to my machine but i don t think there s anything specific about my device in the csr i then get a certificate which i download i then create a development provisioning profile in the process i select the certificate i just created in my company s name but with nothing specific about my device and i check all the devices including those of my friend i then download and install that provisioning profile on my iphone and only that provisioning profile no other profiles or certificates or anything on my device i then build my app signing it with that development provisioning profile i can then install the created ipa on my iphone and it works so what keeps me from sending my friend whose device id i checked when creating the development provisioning profile the same development mobileprovision and ipa files and he can install and run just the same doesn t that get me the same effect as ad hoc deployment without the additional hassles of ad hoc deployment of which i admit there may not be many but there are some >>> iphone signing adhoc

how to use diffrent authentications in a django powered site i currently manage a website coded in django that has standard areas the frontend and backoffice which is built using django s admin interface recently the customer claimed he wanted diffrent authentications one for frontend users and another one for people managing the backoffice until now they both used standard django contrib auth authentication i know i could make the customer to just use diffrent users and maybe disallow the backoffice users to log into the frontend part but they want more changes like session inactivity on the admin side shortened to few minutes while on the frontend to keep it like forever is it possible to define parts of django site to use diffrent authentication with diffrent cookies etc or should i use a diffrent domain for backoffice like to have a frontend on site com and admin on admin site com then have both run as diffrent applications using diffrent settings for cookies etc >>> django django-admin django-authentication

anyone know how malloc info works i ve been trying to figure out how the malloc info function located in malloc h works i know you have to pass it a file and that no options are implemented yet but i am at a loss as to what it is actually reporting furthermore i ve written a test app that allocates a whole bunch of memory and the values reported from malloc info don t change except when i did byte allocations is there anyone out there who has any experience with malloc info and can shed some light on what aspects of memory it is supposed to measure it should be noted that i could find next to nothing on google about malloc info just some sketchy bug reports example output from malloc info lt malloc version gt lt heap nr gt lt sizes gt lt sizes gt lt total type fast count size gt lt total type rest count size gt lt system type current size gt lt system type max size gt lt aspace type total size gt lt aspace type mprotect size gt lt heap gt lt total type fast count size gt lt total type rest count size gt lt system type current size gt lt system type max size gt lt aspace type total size gt lt aspace type mprotect size gt lt malloc gt edit as a further explanation my fallback position is the mallinfo function but i was hoping to use malloc info as from what i can gather it is targeted to replace mallinfo what i ve found is that mallinfo and malloc info do not work the same in my tests mallinfo tracks all my allocations while malloc info fails to do so at all i can only assume that malloc info is currently broken or it is not intended to serve the same purpose as mallinfo in the article given by omnifarious there are good reasons that mallinfo should be deprecated it is completely unsuitable for bit machines the data types required by the sysv spec dont allow for values larger bytes all fields in the structure are ints the second problem is that the data structure is really specific to the malloc implementation sysv used at that time however i think that at this time malloc info is not yet ready to take it s place further edit after a bit more digging it seems that malloc info is reporting the arena size from mallinfo in all places where appears at least that s what it corresponds to this seems much less useful and is a very one dimensional piece of information compared with what mallinfo allows for >>> c++ c gcc gnu

different views in a single wpf window i m doing a vb net subject at university and the major assignment is the creation of a wpf application the application is management focused adding modifying deleting entries etc as these are all rather disparate tasks i m thinking to create a tabbed interface for my assignment in a similar vein to spybot s interface http www spyware com images data images spybot search and destroy jpg i m a bit confused as to how i should go around approaching this btw would this classify as mdi we were recommended to create a menu system that listed all the options upon selecting an option a new window would be opened the interaction would take place if the user wanted to do something else he ll close the window to be taken back to the menu screen this doesn t really seem like an elegant approach to me and it seems like it ll be an interesting exercise to implement the tab based system i explained i d appreciate if anyone could point me in the right directions or give any hints as to how i should achieve is it possible for example to create each option in a separate xaml code behind file and then plug these into each tab edit to clarify let s take a hypothetical of an indoor soccer team management system let s say there are five different tasks the user can perform register a player modify players register a team modify team details add player to team each task is separate from the next one way of creating the application is to create a main page with a button for each task when a user click on each button a new window opens up for example if the user clicks register a player a new playerregistration window is opened what i m looking for as mentioned above is a tab based approach in my application if the user clicks register a player the entire playerregistration xaml file gets loaded in a segment of the window the same happens when the user clicks any other button i suppose one way to think of it would be a website that uses frames note if you think my aim isn t really appropriate and that there s a better way to lay out my application i d love to hear some suggestions >>> .net wpf vb.net tabs mdi

is const cast acceptable when defining an array i have a static const array class member const pointers to sdl surfaces but that s irrelevant and have to loop through it in order to populate it aside from a const cast when i m done looping which i hear is bad practice how would i go about doing this edit the reason i don t just do static sdl surface const myarray class myarray is that i need to read from a different array and run a function on the different array s respective value in order to get the value for this array once i ve looped all the way through i m never changing this array again so the way i see it it should be const edit i think i might have made a conceptual mistake here is it possible to const cast in some way to make something const instead of to remove it s constness which is what i was trying to do if not then i was being a little silly asking this d >>> c++ c const const-cast

graph incidence list implementation i m considering graph data structure implementations and am looking at the incidence list representation there is a brief description of it here incidence list so each vertex in the graph stores a list of those edges upon which it is incident given that my graph is a directed graph i m not very clear from this description on a couple of points does the graph itself also store a list of all edges do vertices only store outgoing edges or incoming and outgoing if both are they in separate lists i m quite familiar with the other graph representations adjacency list adjacency matrix edge list incidence matrix so this isn t a question about graph implementations in general just this particular one any pointers would be much appreciated >>> java graph directed-graph

choosing version control work flow i have been tasked with researching how to improve the way my company handles version control background currently we use borland starteam which has some issues apart from often being difficult to use the number of tools ide support code review which support it is very low our company has something like developers but we work with a lot of different projects a given project usually has something like software developers working together our projects range from mostly embedded systems and fpga development to desktop applications the current work flow is heavily centralized with one view which is close to a branch in starteam language that everyone in the project works on one of the projects use multiple views in the following way there is a platform view where no development is done this view then has two sub views for two specific products that share most code via the platform view but is dissimilar enough to be kept apart all development is made in the two product views and sometimes code from a product view is promoted to the platform view which is then automatically available for the other product another project seems to use a main view and a feature view when there was a major feature addition we usually have to support software for a long time and provide software updates some of our products have a large number of different versions the different versions will share most code but some parts are and must be distinctively different developers use both windows and linux on their development work stations idea my idea is to switch over to use a modern dvcs the work flow i am considering is where each project has a number of public branches which each developer can clone and work on each project could then determine if everyone can commit freely or if we should have some kind of gate keeper system where code needs to pass a human or automated build system before being committed to the public branch my idea on the branching setup is to use release and feature branches as in the following scenario let s say we start with development and finally ship version of our product we then find that we want some more features so we aim for a release and start a new branch for this while working on the release branch we can still do maintenance on the branch leading to the release of version and so on while working on the branch we discover a security problem which is fixed since it is available in the branch as well that code is backported to the branch as well sometime in the branch it is discovered that some parts of the system really needs to be completely redone to be able to create feature x a new public feature x branch is created and worked on when done the work in that branch is merged back into the main branch actual questions hopefully you are still reading at this point is the above work flow release and feature branching a viable option are there pit falls to look out for in the scenario where a product has a platform branch and multiple product branches what is the best way to handle this would creating a master branch and the product branches work is there a problem when two product branches diverge how much can they diverge have i missed something i mostly see vcs from a developer perspective so i might be missing stuff that is important from the perspective of a configuration or release manager >>> version-control

most efficient way to find something recursively in a table i have a table users with the following columns id int primary username target dead target contains an id of another user in the same table all users start out with dead as if dead is then that means they re dead as time goes on dead can change but target column will always stay with whatever it started with if a user dies their target becomes whoever killed them s new target so if i m trying to find the current target of user a i would have to first find their original target and if that target is dead move onto that target s target and so on until i find one that s not dead and that would be the current target of user a currently i have this query that just gives me the original target select `a` `username` `a` `dead` `b` `username` from `users` as `a` left join `users` as `b` on `a` `target` `b` `id` but have no idea how to add to it to give me the current target >>> mysql

reading data from memcache sometimes fails i ve written a gevent based program that allows its web clients to quickly exchange messages through it so it works like a hub since i only support polling mechanism at this moment i ve written it to store messages that need to be delivered to a specific client in its inbox at the server side while the client list is stored in mysql these inboxes are stored in memcache for faster access when a client connects to the hub it pulls all the messages that have accumulated in its inbox the question the problem is that once upon a short while the recipients do not receive their messages when pulling the contents of their inbox they receive an empty array what puzzles me even more is that if i restart the hub the messages that were not received by the clients will suddenly materialize and get delivered to their destinations can you point me if there s a glaring defect in my code do you have any explanation to this effect push is the method that gets executed to place a message into a client s inbox pull is the method that retrieves the list of all the accumulated messages as a list and returns it to the main processing function def push self domain message tid none if tid try messages self mc get s inbox tid encode utf except logging error push memcached failure exc info if messages messages fromjson messages messages append message self mc set s inbox tid encode utf tojson messages print pushed to s inbox tid encode utf def pull self tid try messages self mc get s inbox tid encode utf if messages self mc set s inbox tid encode utf return fromjson messages else return except logging error pull failure exc info return >>> python memcached heisenbug gevent
how to query the windows x index service from bit asp applications recently i stumbled upon a problem that involves moving asp classic sites from a w k server to a w k environment it involved getting indexing services to work with asp classic i searched every where tried many solutions and they all failed the problem running a bit indexing service on a bit application pool for asp classic asp pages running request to the indexing service resulted in error where the server object failed to load although the indexing service was running and the folder containing documents of the site where indexed the indexing service was running in bit mode and the pool in bit mode it was not possible to run some of the suggested solutions was to rewrite the code to use the new windows search but since this is also running in bit it could not be run in bit application mode switching to bit compatible mode off in the pool resulted of not working databases and other com objects used by the asp sites >>> iis-7 asp-classic windows-server-2008-r2 indexing-service

using custom controls in full screen mode of windows media player control in c# i have written a video player app that uses the windowsmediaplayer control i have since started to use photoshop a bit and so decided to create my own buttons and controls for it so i could make it respond in exactly the way i want it to i created a new user control which has a panel with the new buttons docked to the bottom of the control and a windowsmediaplayer control with the uimode property set to none filling the rest of the control this all works fine the problem is that if you are viewing a video in full screen mode you don t get any buttons when the mouse is moved does anyone know if it s possible to have a panel appear on top of the full screen in say the bottom left corner of the screen without exiting full screen mode i m assuming the code would go in the mousehover event and would start with an if statement so it only fires if the fullscreen property is true it s also not necessary that i even use the windowsmediaplayer control i only picked this because i was familiar with it if anyone knows any other controls that would achieve what i m after then i d be open to looking into them thanks in advance >>> c# axwindowsmediaplayer
design pattern s for a webservice enabled telerik treeview for navigation of a document site i am currently working on a document management system in asp net using the telerik ajax toolkit it consists of masterpage with a title banner across the top and a radtreeview down the left hand side for navigation through the site the treeview uses a combination of static nodes and dynamic ones the dynamic nodes are populated via a webservice when a node is clicked the relevant page is navigated to reloading the masterpage and displaying the content of the target page the problem comes from the fact the treeview s dynamic nodes are populated via a webservice and therefore as the user navigates through the tree to find a document the treeview behaves as you would expect however when you get to the bottom of a tree of dynamic nodes the navigation to the page of the navigateurl causes the relevant page to be loaded and then the treeview resets itself to a collapsed state this means the user could be deep in a nest of documents but when they view one the tree collapses and they have to start their navigation all over again this limitation is not going to be acceptable from an ease of use perspective according to telerik this is the designed behaviour for performance reasons the node only ever worries about populating the next set of nodes and therefore the treeviews state is not remembered in viewstate so the meat of question is is the masterpage async treeview navigation design pattern a valid one are there any other ways to have an ajax treeview on a masterpage that remembers it s state when another page is navigated to i have considered a siglepage updatepanel partial page rendering model but the opinions i ve seen on the net infer that this is bad idea it confuses users that expect back forward browser behaviour to navigate through the site but in a single page world they would end up leaving the site i also thought that maybe using a single page container and an iframe may work but this seems to be moving away from the standard design pattern of using masterpages >>> asp.net ajax design-patterns treeview telerik

use server side proxy to set expires header for static resources on another domain i have a web app that links to several thumbnail images from another server on the same domain that i have no configuration control over the page loads about about to mb worth of static images i would really like to have the server owner set the expires header so the images don t re download every single time but unfortunately that s not possible i was considering implementing a very simple proxy that simply passes the data through and injects the expires header my server would take an extra hit for each initial connection as all the images would be proxied but after the first client load the client should just use the cached images and all that bandwidth load times would be spared it seems like a logical thing to do but i can t find anything anywhere that recommends it or find an example where somebody else does this is this a good idea >>> caching proxy http-headers

calculating means of many matrices in numpy i have many csv files which each contain roughly identical matrices each matrix is columns by either or rows the columns are variables and the rows are test conditions some of the matrices do not contain data for the last test condition which is why there are rows in some matrices and six rows in other matrices my application is in python using numpy and sciepy my question is this how can i most efficiently create a summary matrix that contains the means of each cell across all of the identical matrices the summary matrix would have the same structure as all of the other matrices except that the value in each cell in the summary matrix would be the mean of the values stored in the identical cell across all of the other matrices if one matrix does not contain data for the last test condition i want to make sure that its contents are not treated as zeros when the averaging is done in other words i want the means of all the non zero values can anyone show me a brief flexible way of organizing this code so that it does everything i want to do with as little code as possible and also remain as flexible as possible in case i want to re use this later with other data structures i know how to pull all the csv files in and how to write output i just don t know the most efficient way to structure flow of data in the script including whether to use python arrays or numpy arrays and how to structure the operations etc i have tried coding this in a number of different ways but they all seem to be rather code intensive and inflexible if i later want to use this code for other data structures >>> python arrays numpy mean

rails where should a helper that uses h i e html escape live i m writing a webapp in ruby on rails rails automatically escapes any potentially bad strings which is generally a good thing but means if you assemble html yourself you have to call html safe on it i have a card model which has several text fields the contents of which are not trusted may contain evil html or script i have a function which performs a few transforms on one of these text fields using other knowledge about the specific card to produce html output i want to embed the html produced by this function in several places throughout several parts of my app conceptually this helper is to do with the view however i can t find any way to write functions in my view files it seems they have to go in helpers or the controller model since this function is very much specific to a card object the next best option would be to have a function inside my card model card rb class card lt activerecord base def format unsafe text initial text h unsafe text # aka html escape unsafe text # assembles html output based on initial text and fields of self output text html safe end then i d like to call this in assorted views by doing things like rules text lt format card rulestext gt however there s a big problem here as well in the card model card rb i am able to use the html safe function but i m not able to use h or html escape it seems that the h and html escape functions are only available in erb views not in the helpers or controllers there are a few workarounds i can make format not sanitize its input and go rules text lt format h card rulestext gt but that s both prone to dangerous slipups one missing h and we ve got problems and is very non dry at the moment i m using a partial to gain access to the h function in a normal view rules text lt render formattext text gt card rulestext gt app views shared formattext html erb lt card format html escape text gt but this still feels dangerous all i have to do is make single forgetful call to format sometext in a view rather than calling render formattext text gt sometext and i ve got unescaped text running around is there any better way to do this is there a way to write helper functions to live in the view rather than the model or the controller >>> ruby-on-rails partial-views helper

meaning of average complexity when using big o notation while answering to this question a debate began in comments about complexity of quicksort what i remember from my university time is that quicksort is o n in worst case o n log n in average case and o n log n but with tighter bound in best case what i need is a correct mathematical explanation of the meaning of average complexity to explain clearly what it is about to someone who believe the big o notation can only be used for worst case what i remember if that to define average complexity you should consider complexity of algorithm for all possible inputs count how many degenerating and normal cases if the number of degenerating cases divided by n tend towards when n get big then you can speak of average complexity of the overall function for normal cases is this definition right or is definition of average complexity different and if it s correct can someone state it more rigorously than i >>> algorithm complexity-theory big-o

manual inserts on a postgres table with a primary key sequence i m converting a mysql table to postgresql for the first time in my life and running into the traditional newbie problem of having no auto increment now i ve found out that the postgres solution is to use a sequence and then request the nextval of this sequence as the default value every time you insert i ve also read that the serial type creates a sequence and a primary key automatically and that nextval increments the counter even when called inside transactions to avoid locking the sequence what i can t find addressed is the issue of what happens when you manually insert values into a field with a unique or primary constraint and a nextval of a sequence as default as far as i can see this causes the insert to fail when the sequence reaches that value is there a simple or common way to fix this a clear explanation would be very much appreciated update if you feel i shouldn t do this will never be able to fix this or am making some flawed assumptions please feel free to point them out in your answers above all please tell me what to do instead to offer programmers a stable and robust database that can t be corrupted with a simple insert preferably without hiding everything behind stored procedures >>> postgresql primary-key sequence

scale a uitableview to fullscreen from inside a uiscrollview having failed in trying to puzzle together different sources to any form of coherent approach or concept i turn once again to the learned people of stackoverflow my problem is quite specific and maybe that s why i m having trouble finding information that fits or maybe i just suck at searching either way here goes i am building an app which has a uiscrollview populated with uiviews which in turn are populated with uitableviews i have paging and everything set up and working properly basically i am trying to mirror the functionality of safari s mobile tab behaviour or even closer to what i m trying to achieve tweetdeck s main page i couldn t post an image but if you click on the link below you ll see what i mean http www redmondpie com wp content uploads tweetdeckiphone jpg the reason for the uitableviews are inside uiviews is that this was the only way i could figure out to make the tableviews have a space between them instead of being right next to each other i tried setting the size of the tableviews and the inset of the scrollview among many things but the tableviews always ended up filling the entire scrollview in any case that is a separate issue possibly as i click on a tableview uiview inside the scrollview i want that tableview uiview to scale up and fill the entire screen minus tabbar and navigationbar and then i should be able to scale it back down by pressing the back button on the navigationbar any information or nudges in the right direction is greatly appreciated >>> iphone uitableview uiscrollview zoom scale

testing for an invalid windows handle should i compare with null or even nullptr i m coming from a background whereby pointers should generally be compared with null and integers with since i didn t perceive windows handles to be pointers in the pure sense being handles i d got into the habit of comparing them with rather than null clearly they re implemented internally as pointers nowadays but i personally consider that to be merely for acquiring some type safety rather than because they are intrinsically pointers anyway i just noticed that the help for createic which returns an hdc states that if the function fails then it returns null now i m confused and am wondering what other people reckon is it more correct to consider a windows handle to be a pointer and therefore check it against null or nullptr for modern compilers or should it be considered to be an integer >>> c++ windows null handles

executing prolog code on an iphone i currently have the need to execute prolog code in an application i am making i am aware that apple probably never would allow something like this in the app store but that is not the intention either this is more a private project that will never reach the app store purpose in this case prolog is used to describe an object like for example a telephone and its properties the object will be drawn with opengl using coordinates specified in the prolog script the reason for using prolog is that i need the ability to query the program about some of the features this object has and prolog eases this a lot bottom line i need to query a prolog script from my app possible solutions embed an already existing implementation written in c i am unsure if this will even work execute the prolog code on another machine and use the network to query prolog it seems that it is possible to run some sort ruby vm inside the app shinycocos uses this as far as i understand could this be used to run one of the ruby prolog implementations find some alternative to prolog this needs to give me some of the same possibilities i get with prolog sadly google gives me close to no results at all so i have a feeling that i might be quite alone on this project if anyone have any experience or clue at all i would be very thankful >>> iphone prolog logic-programming

linear interpolation in direct digital synthesis i m working on a microcontroller dds project in c and am having some trouble figuring out how to compute a linear interpolation to smooth the output values the program as it stands now uses the top bits of a bit accumulator as an index to an array of bit output values i need to come up with a function that will take the middle and lower byte of the accumulator and generate a value in between the previous and next value in the array this would be straightforward enough on fast hardware but since i m using a microcontroller i really need to avoid doing any floating point operations or divisions with those restrictions i m not certain of a way to go about getting an bit interpolated value from my two bit input numbers and the lower byes of the accumulator which represents the distance between the two input values thanks in advance for any advice clarification dds direct digital synthesis in dds a waveform is generated from a lookup table using a phase accumulator the phase accumulator usually contains an integer component and a fractional component the integer component is used as an index into the lookup table in simple dds implementations the fractional part is ignored but for higher quality output the fractional component is used to interpolate usually just linear interpolation between adjacent lookup table values for the above question we are looking at how to efficiently perform this linear interpolation between two lookup table values for a given fraction f where lt f lt >>> c avr linear-interpolation

quickfix seqnum not reset properly at starttime with odbc store i am using quickfix recompiled with odbc and i have a strange behavior on my acceptors two acceptors on different machines sharing the same odbc database and enabled for hot failover my daily session is setup with refreshonlogon y starttime endtime persistmessages y and the necessary odbc settings at the initiator sends a logout with msgseqnum my quickfix acceptor responds with logout msgseqnum so no problem there at the initiator sends a logon with msgseqnum but my quickfix acceptor responds with logout msgseqnum at the initiator retries with logon and msgseqnumm and this time my quickfix acceptor responds with logon msgseqnum thinking that maybe in the table sessions the incoming seqnum and outgoing seqnum were not properly reset by odbc i even tried to force a reset manually at but in vain i still get the same behavior my guess at the moment is that quickfix with this configuration still matches the logon request against the yesterday session which results in the logout with the yesterday sequence number with the same starttime endtime acceptor instead of two filestore and no refreshonlogon setting because i had only acceptor it used to work with quickfix i also tried with refreshonlogon n but the problem remains the same seqnums are not properly reset at midnight any ideas many thanks >>> quickfix fix
