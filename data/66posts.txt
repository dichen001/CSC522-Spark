decoding t sql cast in c# vb net recently our site has been deluged with the resurgence of the asprox botnet sql injection attack without going into details the attack attempts to execute sql code by encoding the t sql commands in an ascii encoded binary string it looks something like this declare s nvarchar set s cast x f as nvarchar exec s i was able to decode this in sql but i was a little wary of doing this since i didn t know exactly what was happening at the time i tried to write a simple decode tool so i could decode this type of text without even touching sql nbsp server the main part i need decoded is cast x f as nvarchar i ve tried all of the following commands with no luck txtdecodedtext text system web httputility urldecode txturltext text txtdecodedtext text encoding ascii getstring encoding ascii getbytes txturltext text txtdecodedtext text encoding unicode getstring encoding unicode getbytes txturltext text txtdecodedtext text encoding ascii getstring encoding unicode getbytes txturltext text txtdecodedtext text encoding unicode getstring convert frombase string txturltext text what is the proper way to translate this encoding without using sql server is it possible i ll take vb net code since i m familiar with that too okay i m sure i m missing something here so here s where i m at since my input is a basic string i started with just a snippet of the encoded portion c which translates to decla and the first attempt was to do this txtdecodedtext text encoding utf getstring encoding utf getbytes txturl text and all it did was return the exact same thing that i put in since it converted each character into is byte i realized that i need to parse each two characters into a byte manually since i don t know of any methods yet that will do that so now my little decoder looks something like this while boolisdone byturlchar byte parse txturltext text substring intparseindex byturl inturlindex byturlchar intparseindex inturlindex if txturltext text length intparseindex lt boolisdone true txtdecodedtext text encoding utf getstring byturl things look good for the first couple of pairs but then the loop balks when it gets to the c pair and says that the string is in the incorrect format interestingly enough when i step through the debugger and to the getstring method on the byte array that i was able to parse up to that point i get as the result how do i figure out what i m missing do i need to do a direct cast for each byte instead of attempting to parse it >>> c# sql vb.net ascii hex

how to export data from sql server to mysql i ve been banging my head against sql server trying to get a lot of data out i ve been given a database with nearly tables in it and i need to turn this into a mysql database my first call was to use bcp but unfortunately it doesn t produce valid csv strings aren t encapsulated so you can t deal with any row that has a string with a comma in it or whatever you use as a delimiter and i would still have to hand write all of the create table statements as obviously csv doesn t tell you anything about the data types what would be better is if there was some tool that could connect to both sql server and mysql then do a copy you lose views stored procedures trigger etc but it isn t hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one db to another is it does anybody know of such a tool i don t mind how many assumptions it makes or what simplifications occur as long as it supports integer float datetime and string i have to do a lot of pruning normalising etc anyway so i don t care about keeping keys relationships or anything like that but i need the initial set of data in fast >>> mysql sql-server csv sql-server-2005 bcp
